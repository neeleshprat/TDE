<p>Thus the chief note of <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Henrician<!--k03--> settlement is the fact that Anglicanism was founded in the <!--2ref=u79=01094b.htm-->acceptance<!--k01--> of the Royal, and the rejection of the <!--3ref=u91=14257a.htm-->Papal<!--k02--> Supremacy, and was placed upon a decidedly <!--3ref=u94=05514a.htm-->Erastian<!--k02--> basis.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

In a subsequent "Admonition", <!--3ref=u44=x60338.htm-->Elizabeth<!--k07--> issued an interpretation of the Royal Supremacy, to the effect that she laid claim "to no power of <!--3ref=u74=10326a.htm-->ministry<!--k02--> of divine offices in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". At the same time she reasserted in the full the claim made by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> as to the <!--2ref=u68=02137c.htm-->Authority<!--k01--> of the <!--3ref=u44=x58029.htm-->Crown<!--k07--> in matters <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, and the great <!--3ref=u44=x85379.htm-->religious<!--k04--> changes made after her <!--2ref=u73=01095a.htm-->accession<!--k01--> were carried out and enforced in a royal <!--3ref=u44=x86508.htm-->visitation<!--k03--> commissioned by the royal authority.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<p>In 1628, Charles I, in a Royal Declaration prefixed to the <!--3ref=u68=01756a.htm-->Articles<!--k02-->, stated that it belonged to the kingly office "to conserve and maintain the <!--3ref=u63=03744a.htm-->Church<!--k02--> committed to our charge, in <!--3ref=u44=x86371.htm-->unity<!--k03--> of <!--3ref=u44=x85324.htm-->religion<!--k03--> and the bond of peace", and <!--2ref=u69=04670a.htm-->decreed<!--k01--> that differences arising as to the external policy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were to be settled in <!--3ref=u83=04348a.htm-->Convocation<!--k02-->, but its ordinances were to be submitted to the <!--3ref=u44=x58029.htm-->Crown<!--k07--> for approval, which would be given to them if they were not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the land.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<p>Archbishop <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Laud<!--k03-->, in 1640, had a series of <!--3ref=u44=x81192.htm-->canons<!--k04--> drawn up in <!--3ref=u83=04348a.htm-->Convocation<!--k02--> and duly published, but this attempt at <!--3ref=u44=x85931.htm-->spiritual<!--k08--> independence was speedily suppressed.

<h3>The effect of Royal Supremacy</h3>

<p>The effect of the legislation under <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, revived by <!--3ref=u44=x60338.htm-->Elizabeth<!--k07-->, and <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->confirmed<!--k03--> in subsequent reigns, has been, as <!--3ref=u44=x67693.htm-->Lord<!--k03--> Campbell pointed out in his famous Gorham <!--3ref=u44=x83541.htm-->judgment<!--k03-->, in April, 1850, to locate in the <!--3ref=u44=x58029.htm-->Crown<!--k07--> all that decisive <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> which before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> had been exercised by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<p>Until the year 1833, the <!--3ref=u44=x58029.htm-->Crown<!--k07--> exercised this supreme <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> through a special body called the <!--3ref=u44=x57962.htm-->Court<!--k03--> of <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Delegates<!--k03-->. Its members were appointed under the great <!--2ref=u49=13649a.htm-->Seal<!--k01-->, and consisted of <!--2ref=u74=08748a.htm-->lay<!--k01--> <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->judges<!--k03-->, with whom might be associated a number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>. In 1833 this <!--3ref=u44=x57962.htm-->Court<!--k08--> was abolished, and its powers were transferred to the King in <!--3ref=u44=x57900.htm-->Council<!--k03-->. Hence matters which come under its purview are now decided by the King upon the advice of that part of the Privy Council which is known as the Judicial Committee. The statute (2 and 3 William IV, xcii) expressly states that its decisions are final, and are not subject to any commission of review.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<p>It must be observed that this tribunal does not profess theoretically to decide <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, or to pronounce upon the abstract <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a> of opinions. "Its <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> extends only to the consideration of that which is by <!--2ref=u68=09053a.htm-->law<!--k01--> established to be the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, upon the due and <!--3ref=u44=x83688.htm-->legal<!--k03--> construction of there <!--3ref=u68=01756a.htm-->Articles<!--k02--> and <!--2ref=u68=06141a.htm-->formularies<!--k01-->" (Gorham decision, March 1850). But upon this ground the <!--3ref=u44=x58029.htm-->Crown<!--k07--> decided that the views of Mr. Gorham, whose <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> rejection of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> <!--2ref=u76=12714a.htm-->regeneration<!--k01--> had shocked his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> the Tractarians, were "not contrary or repugnant to the declared <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as by <!--3ref=u68=09053a.htm-->law<!--k04--> established". Numerous protests and <!--2ref=u79=01652a.htm-->appeals<!--k01--> were made by high <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Churchmen<!--k03-->, but all attempts to reverse the decision were unavailing, and Mr. Gorham duly received institution to the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> which his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had refused him. In like manner in 1849, when vehement opposition was made to the appointment of Dr. Hampden to the <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">See of Hereford</a>, the <!--2ref=u72=12424a.htm-->Prime<!--k01--> <!--3ref=u74=10326a.htm-->Minister<!--k02--> of the day insisted on the <!--2ref=u73=13055c.htm-->right<!--k01--> of the <!--3ref=u44=x58029.htm-->Crown<!--k07-->, and the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> ruled that no exception could be suffered against one whom the <!--3ref=u44=x58029.htm-->Crown<!--k07--> had duly <!--3ref=u79=11093a.htm-->nominated<!--k02-->, and the <!--3ref=u44=x57962.htm-->Court<!--k08--> of Queen's Bench sustained his ruling.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<p>Thus, whatever views or <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->aspirations<!--k03--> have been held theoretically by Anglican <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->divines<!--k03--> on the <!--3ref=u44=x85931.htm-->spiritual<!--k08--> authority of the Anglican <!--3ref=u63=03744a.htm-->Church<!--k02-->, the Royal Supremacy remains an effective reality, and the <!--3ref=u44=x58029.htm-->Crown<!--k07-->, supported by Parliament and the <!--3ref=u44=x67319.htm-->Law<!--k04--> <!--3ref=u79=04447a.htm-->Courts<!--k02-->, both as to the <!--3ref=u44=x82129.htm-->doctrines<!--k08--> which may be taught, and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who shall be put in office to teach them, has <!--2ref=u76=12315a.htm-->possession<!--k01--> of the practical and <!--2ref=u66=14322c.htm-->substantial<!--k01--> control. It is characteristic of the Anglican <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> that the supreme and far reaching regulative <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> which was exercised by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was, after the severance from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, taken over, to all <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->intents<!--k03--> and purposes, by the <!--3ref=u44=x58029.htm-->Crown<!--k07-->, and was never effectively entrusted to the Anglican <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Spirituality<!--k03-->, either to the <!--2ref=u74=12423b.htm-->Primate<!--k01-->, or to the <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Episcopate<!--k03-->, or even to <!--3ref=u83=04348a.htm-->Convocation<!--k02-->. As a result, there is to this day the lack of a living <!--3ref=u63=03744a.htm-->Church<!--k04--> <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Spiritual<!--k03--> <!--3ref=u68=02137c.htm-->Authority<!--k02--> which has been to the Anglican <!--3ref=u63=03744a.htm-->Church<!--k04--> a constant source of weakness, humiliation, and disorder.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<p>In 1904 a royal commission was appointed to investigate the complaints against <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, and in July 1906, it issued its report, in which it points out that at no <!--2ref=u66=14726a.htm-->time<!--k01--> in the past have the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of public <!--3ref=u44=x86615.htm-->worship<!--k08--> been uniformly observed, and recommends the formation of a <!--3ref=u44=x57962.htm-->Court<!--k08--> which while exercising the Royal <!--2ref=u79=08567a.htm-->Jurisdiction<!--k01-->, would be bound to accept the <!--3ref=u74=02581b.htm-->episcopate<!--k02--> on questions of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> or <!--3ref=u72=09306a.htm-->ritual<!--k02-->. This, if granted, would be the first step towards the partial emancipation of the <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Spirituality<!--k06--> from the thraldom of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>, in which it has been held for more than three centuries.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<p>It will be observed that Anglicanism as a <!--3ref=u44=x85379.htm-->religious<!--k04--> system is separable from the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Royal Supremacy, which is an outcome of its union with the State, and of the circumstances of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. In countries outside of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> Anglican <!--3ref=u44=x57134.htm-->Churches<!--k07--> <!--2ref=u76=06608b.htm-->exist<!--k01-->, and, it is said, all the more prosperously from being untrammelled by the State connection. But even in those countries the decisive voice in the government of the Anglican <!--3ref=u63=03744a.htm-->Church<!--k02--> is not entrusted to the <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Episcopate<!--k06--> alone, and in some of them the <!--3ref=u74=08748a.htm-->lay<!--k02--> power in the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> has made itself felt, and has shown that it can be as really a master as any Tudor sovereign invested with royal supremacy. The supremacy of the <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Spirituality<!--k06--> in the domain of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, as the sole guarantee of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <!--3ref=u44=x85379.htm-->religious<!--k04--> liberty, is still lacking in the Anglican system, and the problem of supplying it remains unsolved, if not insoluble.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> position of the Anglican <!--3ref=u63=03744a.htm-->Church<!--k02-->, in like manner, can only be adequately studied in its <!--3ref=u44=x83178.htm-->history<!--k03-->, which divides itself into a number of stages or periods. The first, or <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Henrician<!--k06-->, period (1534-47) includes the breach with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the setting up of an independent national <!--3ref=u44=x81429.htm-->church<!--k03-->, and the transfer of the supreme <!--3ref=u63=03744a.htm-->Church<!--k04--> authority from the <!--3ref=u60=11451b.htm-->Papacy<!--k02--> to the <!--3ref=u44=x58029.htm-->Crown<!--k07-->. The <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Edwardian<!--k03--> (1547-53) and the Elizabethan (1558-1603) periods carried the work of separation much further.

The <!--3ref=u91=06484b.htm-->Germans<!--k03--> presented as a basis of agreement a number of <!--3ref=u68=01756a.htm-->Articles<!--k02--> based on the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <!--3ref=u44=x57544.htm-->Confession<!--k03--> of <!--3ref=u44=x53246.htm-->Augsburg<!--k03-->.

<h3>Second period: Edward VI (1547-1553)</h3>

<p>By the death of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> (27 January, 1547) the main obstacle to the reforming influence was removed. With the <!--3ref=u73=01095a.htm-->accession<!--k02--> of Edward VI, who had been brought up in the reformed <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, with Seymour, also a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> in the <!--3ref=u44=x57900.htm-->Council<!--k08-->, and Cranmer, now able to show his hand and work his <!--3ref=u44=x86573.htm-->will<!--k03-->, the party of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> became possessed of all the resources of national power, and during the five years of the reign (1547-53) remained triumphantly in the ascendant. This period <!--2ref=u79=15677a.htm-->witnessed<!--k01--> the introduction of the great <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> changes.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<!--k93--><p><em>Denial of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>. &mdash;</em> One of the <!--3ref=u44=x81207.htm-->cardinal<!--k03--> principles of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> which the <!--3ref=u44=x62935.htm-->German<!--k04--> delegates had brought over in 1538 was that "the <!--3ref=u44=x68703.htm-->Mass<!--k03--> is nothing but a <!--3ref=u44=x57491.htm-->Communion<!--k03--> or <!--2ref=u48=14383a.htm-->synaxis<!--k01-->" (Tunstall's Summary, M.S. Cleop. E. V., 209). Cranmer vehemently upheld this conception of the <!--3ref=u44=x60682.htm-->Eucharist<!--k03-->. One of the first <!--3ref=u44=x51273.htm-->Acts<!--k03--> under Edward VI was the introduction of a new <!--3ref=u44=x60511.htm-->English<!--k04--> <!--3ref=u44=x57491.htm-->Communion<!--k07--> <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Service<!--k03-->, which was to be inserted at the end of the <!--3ref=u44=x68703.htm-->Mass<!--k04-->, and which required <!--3ref=u44=x57491.htm-->Communion<!--k07--> to be given under both kinds. This was soon after followed by a <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Book of Common Prayer</a>, with a <!--3ref=u44=x57491.htm-->Communion<!--k07--> <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Service<!--k06--> entirely taking the place of the <!--3ref=u44=x67283.htm-->Latin<!--k03--> <!--3ref=u44=x68703.htm-->Mass<!--k08-->. Cranmer was the chief author of this book. Whether it ever received the assent of <!--3ref=u83=04348a.htm-->Convocation<!--k02--> has been questioned, but it was approved by Parliament in 1549. Gardiner, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, in opposing <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Cranmer's<!--k03--> denial of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a> and of the <!--2ref=u76=13309a.htm-->Sacrifice<!--k01--> of the mass, argued that even <!--2ref=u66=03539b.htm-->certain<!--k01--> passages in the new <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Prayer Book</a> implied the <!--3ref=u79=01094b.htm-->acceptance<!--k02--> of these <!--3ref=u44=x82129.htm-->doctrines<!--k08-->; whereupon Cranmer and his fellow-reformers drew up a new <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Prayer Book</a>, still more <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> in tone and <!--3ref=u44=x81343.htm-->character<!--k03-->. In it the order of the parts of the <!--3ref=u44=x57491.htm-->Communion<!--k07--> <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Service<!--k06--> was considerably altered, and the passages used by Gardiner as apparently favouring the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> were studiously eliminated, or so changed as to preclude in future any such interpretation, and all allusion to <!--3ref=u44=x51844.htm-->Altar<!--k03--> or <!--3ref=u76=13309a.htm-->Sacrifice<!--k02--> was carefully omitted (Gasquet and <!--3ref=u74=02581b.htm-->Bishop<!--k03-->, Edward VI and the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Book of Common Prayer</a>, 289). In 1552, this, the second <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Prayer Book</a> of Edward VI, was authorized by Parliament. A new Ordinal or <!--3ref=u44=x70679.htm-->Order<!--k03--> for making <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> was compiled, from which in like manner all mention of the <!--3ref=u76=13309a.htm-->sacrificial<!--k03--> office of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was rigorously excluded. It was approved by Parliament in 1552. In 1551, quite in <!--3ref=u44=x83055.htm-->harmony<!--k03--> with this <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> reform, an <!--3ref=u44=x70679.htm-->Order<!--k07--> in <!--3ref=u44=x57900.htm-->Council<!--k08--> issued to Bishop Ridley required the <!--2ref=u78=01362a.htm-->altars<!--k01--> to be torn down, and movable tables substituted, while a statement of reasons was to be made to the people explanatory of the change, namely, "that the <!--3ref=u66=06137b.htm-->form<!--k02--> of a table may more move and turn the simple from the old <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> of the <!--3ref=u44=x68703.htm-->Mass<!--k08--> and to the right use of the <!--3ref=u44=x67692.htm-->Lord's<!--k03--> <!--2ref=u84=14341a.htm-->Supper<!--k01-->".<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<h2>Use of liturgical reform to deny the Sacrifice</h2>

<p>The comparison of the Anglican <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Book<!--k07--> and Ordinal with the <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Pre-Reformation<!--k03--> <!--3ref=u68=06141a.htm-->formularies<!--k02--> which they replaced leads to a second conclusion which in <!--3ref=u44=x83055.htm-->harmony<!--k07--> with the above. On making an <!--2ref=u66=01450a.htm-->analysis<!--k01--> of what has been removed, and what has been retained, and what has been altered, it becomes unmistakably apparent that the main motive which determined and guided the construction of the new <!--3ref=u72=09306a.htm-->liturgy<!--k02--> was the same as that which <!--3ref=u96=08045a.htm-->inspired<!--k02--> the whole <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> movement, namely: <em>the determination to have the <!--3ref=u44=x67692.htm-->Lord's<!--k07--> <!--3ref=u84=14341a.htm-->Supper<!--k02--> regarded only as a <!--3ref=u63=13295a.htm-->Sacrament<!--k02--> or <!--3ref=u44=x57491.htm-->Communion<!--k07-->, and not as a <!--3ref=u76=13309a.htm-->Sacrifice<!--k02--></em>, and to remove whatever indicated the <!--3ref=u76=13309a.htm-->sacrificial<!--k07--> <!--3ref=u44=x81343.htm-->character<!--k02--> of the <!--3ref=u44=x60682.htm-->Eucharist<!--k04-->, or the <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Real<!--k03-->, <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Objective<!--k03--> <!--2ref=u63=05573a.htm-->Presence<!--k01-->, in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense, in which <!--3ref=u44=x56694.htm-->Christ<!--k08--> is <!--2ref=u46=15710a.htm-->worshipped<!--k01--> in the <!--3ref=u78=07489d.htm-->Host<!--k02-->.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<h2>Development and parties</h2>

<!--k93--><p>Although the Anglican <!--3ref=u68=01756a.htm-->Articles<!--k02--> and <!--3ref=u72=09306a.htm-->liturgy<!--k02--> have been practically unchanged since 1662, it was inevitable that the <!--3ref=u44=x83737.htm-->life<!--k03--> and thought of a <!--3ref=u44=x85379.htm-->religious<!--k04--> body like the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> should present the note of development, and that such development should eventually out grow, or at least strain, the <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->historic<!--k07--> interpretation of the <!--3ref=u68=06141a.htm-->formularies<!--k02-->, and the more so because there has been no living authority to adapt or readjust them to the newer needs or <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->aspirations<!--k07-->. The development may be said to have been guided by three main influences. <ul> <li>There has been the deep-seated attachment to the principles of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in which the Anglican settlement was founded, and the determination to preserve the standards of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and <!--3ref=u44=x86615.htm-->worship<!--k08--> then established. This loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <!--3ref=u44=x81343.htm-->character<!--k02--> of the Anglican <!--3ref=u63=03744a.htm-->Church<!--k04--> has produced the <a href="../cathen/09399a.htm">Low Church</a>, or <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Evangelical<!--k03-->, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Anglicanism. <li>A second influence is that of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>, which, both in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, has <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->acted<!--k03--> as a solvent of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, especially in the form of destructive <!--2ref=u96=04497a.htm-->biblical criticism<!--k01-->, and which, often in the effort to sublimate <!--3ref=u44=x85324.htm-->religion<!--k04-->, has induced an aversion to all that is <!--2ref=u76=05089a.htm-->dogmatic<!--k01-->, <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>. Its exponents, who are numerous, learned, and influential, are generally classed as the Broad <!--3ref=u63=03744a.htm-->Church<!--k04-->, or the <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Latitudinarian<!--k03-->, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Anglican <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> thought. <li>A third influence which made itself felt upon Anglicanism, and one more vital and more penetrating and progressive than the other two, has been that of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, whether as reflected in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> antiquity or as beheld in the actual <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. The effect of this influence may be traced in what has been called the <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->historic<!--k07--> High Church party. A number of Anglican <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->divines<!--k06--> in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, while bitterly opposed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and loyally <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, stood above the prevailing low level of <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->churchmanship<!--k03-->, and put forward higher and <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->philocatholic<!--k03--> views, in the matters of <!--3ref=u63=03744a.htm-->Church<!--k04--> authority, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, and <!--3ref=u44=x86615.htm-->worship<!--k08-->. Although comparatively few in number, and vehemently assailed by their fellow <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a>, they were <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->destined<!--k03--> to serve as a <em>point d'appui</em> for a subsequent development. Such writers as Bishop Andrews (d. 1626), Bishop Overall (d. 1644), Bishop Montague (d. 1641), <!--3ref=u44=x52758.htm-->Archbishop<!--k08--> <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Laud<!--k06--> (d. 1644), <!--3ref=u44=x52758.htm-->Archbishop<!--k08--> <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Bramhall<!--k03--> (d. 1663), <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Dr. Thorndike<!--k03--> (d. 1672), Bishop Ken (d. 1711), Dr <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Waterland<!--k03--> (d. 1740), may be regarded as representative of this section. </ul><!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->
<h2>Oxford Movement</h2>

<p>(See also <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">OXFORD MOVEMENT</a>.)<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<p>In 1833 a strong current of popular opinion directed against the Anglican <!--3ref=u63=03744a.htm-->Church<!--k02--> aroused in its defense the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of a small band of <!--3ref=u44=x70926.htm-->Oxford<!--k03--> students and writers, who gradually gathered under the informal leadership of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">John Henry Newman.</a> Among these were <!--3ref=u44=x66336.htm-->John<!--k03--> Keble, C. <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Marriott<!--k03-->, <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Hurrell<!--k03--> Froude, <!--3ref=u44=x65121.htm-->Isaac<!--k03--> Williams, <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Dr. Pusey</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">W.G.

Their task led them to look both behind and outside the sphere of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<p>By forming a catena of Anglican High Church <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->divines<!--k06--> of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries on one side, and a catena of <!--3ref=u66=03539b.htm-->certain<!--k02--> <!--3ref=u44=x61583.htm-->Fathers<!--k03--> on the other, it was <!--2ref=u76=07465b.htm-->hoped<!--k01--> that a quasi-continuous chain of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a> could be made to connect the Anglican <!--3ref=u63=03744a.htm-->Church<!--k02--> of their day with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> antiquity. Translations of the <!--3ref=u44=x61583.htm-->Fathers<!--k08-->, works on <!--3ref=u72=09306a.htm-->liturgy<!--k02-->, the <!--2ref=u80=06021b.htm-->festivals<!--k01--> of the "Christian Year", and above all a memorable series of "Tracts for the Times", conveyed with telling force the newer and broader conceptions of <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->churchmanship<!--k05--> which entered into the <!--3ref=u44=x85915.htm-->spirit<!--k03--> of the defenders.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<p>In "Tract 90" an attempt was made, somewhat on the lines of <a href="../cathen/01056a.htm">Sancta Clara</a>, to show that the Anglican <!--3ref=u68=01756a.htm-->Articles<!--k02--> might in certain aspects be reconciled to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. The result was a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> and <!--2ref=u64=12275b.htm-->devotional<!--k01--> crisis such as <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> had not <!--3ref=u79=15677a.htm-->witnessed<!--k02--> since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, and the <!--3ref=u44=x70926.htm-->Oxford<!--k04--> or Tractarian movement, during the twelve years from <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Keble's<!--k03--> <!--3ref=u72=07448a.htm-->sermon<!--k02--> on "National Apostasy", in 1833, to <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> <!--2ref=u76=04347a.htm-->conversion<!--k01--> in 1845, formed a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->historic<!--k07--> epoch in the annals of Anglicanism. The fact that the work of the movement was informally a study <em>de Ecclesi&acirc;</em> brought both the writers and their readers more directly face to face with the claims of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<p>A large number of those who took part in the movement, and notably its great leader, became <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, while others, in remaining Anglicans, gave a new and pro-Catholic direction and impulse to Anglican thought and <!--3ref=u44=x86615.htm-->worship<!--k08-->. It may be said that in the case of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, <a href="../cathen/11173a.htm">Oakley</a>, <a href="../cathen/15620c.htm">Wilberforce</a>, <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a>, and a host of others, the research of the <!--3ref=u66=10715a.htm-->nature<!--k02--> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a> brought them to realize the need of the living voice of a Divine <!--2ref=u76=15006b.htm-->magisterium<!--k01--> (the <em>regula proxima fidei</em>), and failing to find it in the Anglican <!--3ref=u74=02581b.htm-->episcopate<!--k02-->, they sought it where alone it could be found.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<p>Others, like <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a>, <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Marriott<!--k06-->, Keble, sought what they called the voice of the "Church" in the inanimate <!--3ref=u68=06141a.htm-->formularies<!--k02--> (or <em>regula remota</em>) which, after all, was merely adding the <!--3ref=u44=x61583.htm-->Fathers<!--k08-->, the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->definitions<!--k03--> to the <!--3ref=u96=13635b.htm-->Scripture<!--k02--> as the area over which they still used, after the manner of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, their private <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->judgement<!--k03-->.

<h2>Anglican revival</h2>

<p>Although the <!--3ref=u44=x70926.htm-->Oxford<!--k04--> movement is regarded as having come to a close at the <!--3ref=u76=04347a.htm-->conversion<!--k02--> of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Dr. Newman</a> in 1845, a large section of the Anglican public had been much too profoundly stirred by its ideals ever to return to the narrowness of the <!--3ref=u44=x85379.htm-->religious<!--k04--> horizons which were bounded by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Its influence has survived in the unceasing flow of <!--3ref=u76=04347a.htm-->converts<!--k03--> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and is shown in the Anglican <!--3ref=u63=03744a.htm-->Church<!--k02--> itself by the notable change of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, temperament, and practice which is known as the Anglican <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Revival<!--k03-->.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<p>The last fifty years (1860-1910) have <!--3ref=u79=15677a.htm-->witnessed<!--k02--> the development of an influential and growing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> thought which, amid the inconsistencies of its position, has steadily laboured to <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Catholicize<!--k03--> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. It has set up the claim, <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->hopelessly<!--k06--> untenable in the face of <!--3ref=u44=x83173.htm-->historical<!--k08--> evidence, that the Anglican <!--3ref=u63=03744a.htm-->Church<!--k04--> is one and continuous with the <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Ancient<!--k03--> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the country, and is an integral portion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of today. It professes to be able to give to Anglicans all that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> gives to her members, <!--2ref=u76=13407a.htm-->save<!--k01--> <!--3ref=u44=x81558.htm-->communion<!--k07--> with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Through <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->possessing<!--k03--> neither the learning nor the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> of the Tractarians, it exercises a wider and more practical influence, and has won the favour of a large body of the Anglican public by importing into the Anglican services something of the beauty and power which it has borrowed from <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> and <!--3ref=u72=09306a.htm-->ritual<!--k02-->. At the same time it has in many centers earned the respect and attachment of the masses by the example of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and self-sacrifice given by its <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<p>It was <!--3ref=u44=x84242.htm-->natural<!--k03--> that this advance section of the Anglican <!--3ref=u63=03744a.htm-->Church<!--k02--> should seek to ratify its position, and to escape from its fatal isolation, by desiring some scheme of corporate reunion and especially by endeavouring to obtain some recognition of the <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">validity of its orders</a>. With the <!--2ref=u66=15073a.htm-->truest<!--k01--> <!--3ref=u44=x81358.htm-->charity<!--k03-->, which consists in the candour of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> on <!--2ref=u76=15179a.htm-->Unity<!--k01-->, pointed out that there can be no reunion expect on the solid basis of <!--3ref=u76=05089a.htm-->dogmatic<!--k02--> <!--3ref=u44=x86371.htm-->unity<!--k08--> and submission to the divinely instituted authority of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. In September, 1896, after a full and exhaustive inquiry, he issued a <a href="../cathen/01644a.htm">Bull</a> declaring <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Anglican Orders</a> to be "utterly null and void", and in a subsequent <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> addressed to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he required all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to accept this <!--3ref=u44=x83541.htm-->judgment<!--k08--> as "fixed, settled, and irrevocable" (<em>firmum, ratum et irrevocabile</em>).<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<p>The Anglican <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Revival<!--k06--> continues to reiterate its claim and to appropriate to itself, where practical, whatever in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, <!--3ref=u72=09306a.htm-->liturgy<!--k02-->, and practice, <!--3ref=u44=x81429.htm-->church<!--k04--> <!--2ref=u78=15388a.htm-->vestments<!--k01--> or <!--3ref=u44=x81429.htm-->church<!--k04--> furniture, it finds helpful to its purpose. By the Lambeth <!--3ref=u44=x83541.htm-->judgment<!--k08--> of 1891 it acquired a public <!--2ref=u68=13428a.htm-->sanction<!--k01--> for many of its innovations. Since then it has gone further, and holds that no authority in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> can override things which are authorized by "<!--2ref=u76=03449a.htm-->Catholic<!--k01--> <!--3ref=u79=04283a.htm-->consent<!--k02-->". It stands thus in the illogical and unhistorical position of a system which is <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->philocatholic<!--k05--> in its views and <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->aspirations<!--k07-->, but <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->hopelessly<!--k06--> committed to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> communication, and built upon an <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->essentially<!--k07--> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->foundation<!--k04-->. Although to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> its very claim is an impious usurpation of what belongs of <!--3ref=u73=13055c.htm-->right<!--k02--> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone, it fulfils an informal mission of influencing <!--3ref=u44=x60511.htm-->English<!--k04--> public opinion, and of familiarizing the <!--3ref=u44=x60511.htm-->English<!--k04--> people with <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrines</a> and ideals.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->

<p>Like the <!--3ref=u44=x70926.htm-->Oxford<!--k04--> movement, it <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educates</a> more pupils than it can retain, and works upon premises which cannot but carry it in the long run farther than it is willing to go. A branch theory which is repudiated by the principal branches, or a <!--2ref=u79=12514a.htm-->province<!--k01--> theory which is unknown to the rest of the provinces, and a continuity theory of which more than twelve thousand documents in the Record <!--3ref=u44=x70504.htm-->Office<!--k03--> and the Vatican Library are the overwhelming refutation, cannot form a standing ground which is other than temporary and transitional. In the meantime, its work amongst the masses is often a <!--2ref=u66=14210a.htm-->species<!--k01--> of <!--2ref=u74=03430b.htm-->catechumenate<!--k01--> for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and in all cases it is an active solvent and a steady undoing of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>.<!--BIBLE-SUMMA-FATHERS-->
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<!--k95--><p>The number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the world (1910) is said to exceed 230,000,000 (estimates by M. Fournier de Flaix, see The <!--3ref=u44=x51945.htm-->American<!--k03--> <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm-->Statistical<!--k03--> <!--2ref=u73=02001c.htm-->Association<!--k01--> Quarterly for March 1892). The number belonging to the <!--3ref=u44=x63516.htm-->Greek<!--k03--> and <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> is about 100,000,000. The number of Anglicans in all countries is something less than 25,000,000. Thus the relative proportion of those three <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> bodies which are sometimes grouped as being <!--2ref=u94=12493a.htm-->Episcopalian<!--k01--> in constitution may be fairly stated by the three figures 23, 10, 2.5. The growth of Anglicanism has followed mainly upon the expansion of the <!--2ref=u52=01505a.htm-->Anglo-Saxon<!--k01--> race. Its area may be said to include, besides the three nucleal countries (<a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>), six others, namely: the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11040a.htm">New Zealand</a>, South <!--2ref=u91=01181a.htm-->Africa<!--k01-->, and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. But the bulk of its membership, in fact more than two-thirds, is to be found in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In all the other countries of its areas it is in a minority of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population. In five of them&mdash;<a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> &mdash; its numbers are considerably exceeded by those of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Its foreign missions are very generously supported, and have extended their activity far into the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> countries.

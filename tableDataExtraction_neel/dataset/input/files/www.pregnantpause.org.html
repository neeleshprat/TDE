<h2>Discussion</h2>

<h3>Why is fertility rate important?</h3>

Fertility rate is, basically, the number of children that the average woman will have in her lifetime.<p>

If the average woman has exactly two children in her lifetime, this is just enough to replace herself
and one man, and thus maintain the population.<p>

Ultimately, this is the <i>only</i> thing that matters in determining long-term
population growth. If the average woman has two children, then the number of people in the next generation will
be the same as the number of people in this generation. You often hear people say that improved diet or
medicene or other things that cause people to live longer cause population to grow, or that wars or
other disasters cause population to shrink. But this is only true indirectly: only if it changes the number
of children that the average woman has in her lifetime. That is, if many women die while still young,
they may not live long enough to have all the children that they otherwise might have had. But beyond that,
how long people live doesn't matter. Everybody still dies sooner or later. If a war wipes out a large
number of people, this causes an immediate drop in the population, of course. For the time that the war
lasts population growth becomes negative. But once the war is over, if the number of children per woman
is the same, the old population growth rate will immediately resume. There is a temporary change in the
total numbers, but the rate of growth does not change.<p>

<h3>How is fertility rate calculated?</h3>

The alert reader may have noticed that in my definition of fertility above I threw in the qualifying
word "basically". You might at first think that it would be easy to calculate the number of children
that the average woman has in her lifetime: Just add up the number of children that each woman has
and divide by the total number of women. But there's a catch: To do that would require that we wait
until all the women that we are interested in have lived their entire lives and died (or at least,
lived long enough to have passed their child-bearing years). But we want to have a number <i>now</i>,
not fifty years from now. Besides, when would we start and stop? By the time we've waited forty or
fifty years move women have been born and had children.<p>

So the way we really calculate fertility is like this: For a given year, we count the percentage of women
of any given age who had a child that year, total up these percentages for all ages, and divide
by 100.
For example,
suppose -- just to make things simple for an example -- that women only have children when they are
between the ages of 18 and 21, and that there are no twins or other circumstances where a woman has
more than one child in a year. Then say that 20% of the 18-year-olds had a baby, 40% of the 19-year-olds,
50% of the 20-year-olds, and 30% of the 21-year-olds. Adding these up gives 140%, so the average
woman in this hypothetical society has 1.4 children in her lifetime.<p>

Of course in real life women women are typically having children from ages 17 or 18 up to their 30's, and
some have children even younger or older, so there are a lot more than four numbers to add together.
But the princple is the same as
the example; the calculations are just more tedious.<p>

This sounds like it should give an exact number, but in fact there's one big catch: Some women don't
live to reach any given age. When we count what percentage of women of a given age have a baby
this year, of course we're only counting the percentage of <i>living</i> women. Going back to our
example, suppose that in this hypothetical society, not only do women only have children between the ages of
18 and 21, but also suppose that half the women die the day before their 21st birthday. Then even though
30% of the 21-year-olds are having a baby, this is not 30% of the women who were born 21 years ago, because
half of those women are dead. It's really only 15% of the women who <i>are 21, or who would have been 21 if
they were still alive</i>. (Assuming none of the women die before they reach 20 for some other reason.)
Thus, the actual number of children per woman is more like 1.25.<p>

So the number would be more accurate if instead of counting the percentage of, say, women age 21 who have children
this year, we could count the percentage of women who were born 21 years ago who have children this
year, including both the living women and the dead women. (Of course the dead women are not having children --
barring some weird horror movie plot -- but including them in the calculation reduces the percentage.)
Unfortunately, people just don't keep statistics this way, so we don't have the information available
to calculate this.<p>

Another minor adjustment is that slightly more boy babies are born than girl babies, so a woman must
have slightly more than two children to make up for this. That is, as fewer girls are born than boys,
each girl was to work a little harder at the baby business to make up the difference.<p>

In practice, then a calculated fertility rate of 2.0 doesn't <i>really</i> mean that the population is
exactly replacing itself: it's slightly short.
For wealthy
places with good medical care, like North America and Europe, maintaining the population requires
a calculated rate of about 2.1 to 2.2.
For poorer countries, where many women don't live out their
child-bearing years, and many little girls don't live long enough to have even one child, the
calculated rate must be significantly higher.<p>

<h3>So countries with fertility rates less than 2.0 (or 2.2) are shrinking?</h3>

Not necessarily: Life is more complicated than that.<p>

The calculated fertility rate is a trend for a given period of time. Many other factors are involved.<p>

Some are simple: For example, if a country has many immigrants, even if the natives aren't having many babies, the
population could still be growing.<p>

Some are more complex: Suppose that in a given society the average woman is having less than two children.
But right now the number of women in their child-bearing years is very large compared to the number of older
people. With fewer older people, the death rate will be low, so for a time the relatively small number of
children born could still be enough to make up for the older people dying. Such a situation could last
for decades. <i>Eventually</i>, this "bulge" of people in child-bearing years will grow old and be
replaced by a smaller generation. Now there are a large number of old people
dying off, while there is a smaller set of people in their child-bearing years to produce their
replacements. Even if they have significantly more than two children per woman, that might not be
enough to replace all the old people dying.<p>

In fact, this is exactly what is happening in the United States and some European countries right now.
Woman are not having enough children to replace themselves-plus-one-man. But it so happens that
there are an unusually
large number of women of child-bearing age compared to the number of old people, plus these countries
have relatively high rates of immigration, so the population continues to grow despite the low
fertility rate.<p>

But this can't last forever. Ultimately fertility rates will have to rise or population will begin
to fall.<p>

It's always dangerous to project current trends decades into the future. Life is too complicated for that.
But <i>if</i> fertility rates continue, then within a few decades the population of the United States
and Europe will begin to fall. This is already happening in Russia and Italy. Some statisticians
have estimated that were it not for illegal immigrants, the population of the United States would
be falling today.<p>

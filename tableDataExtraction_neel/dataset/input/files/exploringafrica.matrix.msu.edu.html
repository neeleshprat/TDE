  <h1>Unit Two: Studying Africa through the Social Studies</h1>
  <h2>Module 7B: African History, the Era of Global Encroachment</h2>
  <strong>
  <p>Student's Edition</p>
  </strong>
  <h2>Activity Four: African Resistance, Nationalism and Independence: Explain</h2>
  <p>There were a variety of responses on the part of African peoples to colonial
    rule. Supporters of colonialism in Europe claimed that the average African
    person welcomed colonialism. Colonialism, they argued, brought the end of
    slavery in East and Central Africa and brought a stop to inter-kingdom warfare
    in parts of West Africa. While there is some truth to the claim that colonialism
    brought peace to a few areas in Africa, and that there were some peoples
    who were initially thankful for an end to violence in their areas, the historical
    evidence does not support the claim that there was widespread support for
    colonial rule. Indeed, there is also considerable evidence of strong resistance
    to colonial rule. </p>
  <p>By the beginning of World War I in 1914, all of Africa, with the exception
    of Liberia and Ethiopia, had been colonized, and initial African resistance
    had been overcome by the colonial powers. Over the next decades as colonial
    rule became institutionalized, African resistance to colonialism became more
    focused and intense. By the 1950s, there were organized nationalist parties
    that demanded political independence in almost every colony in Africa. </p>
  <p>In this final section of this module, we will look at four phases of African
    reaction to colonial rule: early resistance, demand for equity and inclusion,
    nationalism/mass movement, and struggle for national liberation.</p>
  <h2>Early (Primary) Resistance to Colonialism</h2>
  <p>Early African reaction to European intrusion into Africa in the late 19th
    century was not uniform. A few groups that had suffered from long-term warfare
    or slave raiding (such as in parts of East Africa) gave an uncertain welcome
    to European presence in their regions in hope that there would be peace.
    Other groups strongly resisted the coming of European political control.
    However, many people had no initial reaction to colonialism. This was because
    the early years colonialism had little impact on the lives of many rural
    African peoples. This situation changed as the impact of colonialism became
    more widespread and intense in the middle decades of the 20th century.</p>
  <p>Throughout the period of the <i>Scramble for Africa</i>, European colonizers
    faced stiff resistance in many parts of Africa. It would take up too much
    time and space to present information on all instances of resistance. The
    map below identifies seven examples of early resistance to colonial rule
    from across Africa. The numbers in the list below correspond to those on
    the map. By clicking on a number from the list, you will receive information
    on that particular expression of resistance.</p>

  <h2>Demands for Equity and Inclusion: The Inter-War Years</h2>
  <p>By the end of World War I, most of Africa had been effectively colonized.
    European colonialists had managed to <i>quell</i> the efforts by Africans
    to resist the establishment of colonial rule. The next two decades, the period
    historians call the inter-war years, were relatively quiet years in colonial
    Africa. This relative quiet, however, did not indicate that the colonized
    people of Africa were happy with colonial rule-that there was no opposition
    to colonialism. </p>
  <p>During the inter-war years opposition to colonialism was expressed in one
    of the following forms:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Demands for opportunity and inclusion</i>: Many Africans at this time
      accepted the reality of colonial rule but they did not accept the harsh
      discrimination and the lack of opportunity that was a central part of the
      colonial experience. Opposition to these aspects of colonialism was particularly
      strong among educated Africans. Educated Africans believed that "all humans
      are created equal." Discriminatory colonial policies and practice restricted
      economic opportunities and participation in the political process. During
      this period, educated Africans formed organizations to promote their interest
      for an end to discriminatory policies and for an increase in opportunities.
      However, these organizations had limited membership, and they did not make
      radical demands for the end of colonial rule. The South African National
      Congress and the West African National Congress (Nigeria/Ghana) are examples
      of elite African organizations. </li>
    <li><i>Religious opposition</i>: A number of the early anti-colonial up-risings
      featured in the last section were led by religious leaders. The Chimurenga
      (Zimbabwe) and Maji-Maji (Tanganyika) uprisings were led by African priests
      who were strongly opposed to colonial rule. This tradition of religious
      opposition to colonialism continued throughout the 20th century. However,
      unlike the earlier acts of religious resistance, the new opposition was
      led by African Christians. African Christians took seriously the Christian
      teachings on equality and fairness-values that were not practiced by colonial
      regimes. By the 1920s, some African Christian leaders were forming their
      own churches, sometimes called African Independent Churches. These churches
      that were formed in Southern, Eastern, Central and West Africa, provided
      a strong voice for justice. One of many examples is the Kimbaguist Christian
      Church formed in the Congo by Simon Kimbangu in the 1920s. In spite of
      Kimbangu's imprisonment for many years by the Belgians, the Kimbanguist
      church grew rapidly. When the Congo became independent in 1960, the church
      had a membership of over one million. </li>
    <li><i>Economic opposition</i>: During this time period economic opposition
      was often not well organized. However, there were attempts in the 1920s
      and 1930s by mine workers in southern Africa and port workers in West and
      East Africa to organize into unions. While important, these activities
      had little impact on the majority of African peoples. Of greater impact
      were the less organized but more widespread efforts of African farmers
      to resist colonial demands on their labor and their land. <i>Module Nine:
      African Economies</i> provides an example of how small scale African farmers
      in Mali quietly, but effectively, resisted the attempts by colonial officials
      to control the production of cotton. </li>
    <li><i>Mass protests</i>: During the inter-war era, there were few mass protests
      against colonial policies. One of the most important and interesting exceptions
      was the <i>Aba Women's War</i> that took place in southeastern Nigeria
      in 1929. Ibo market women were upset with a number of colonial policies
      that threatened their economic and social position. In 1929, the women
      staged a series of protests. The largest protest included more than 10,000
      women who had covered their faces with blue paint and carried fern-covered
      sticks. The women were able to destroy a number of colonial buildings before
      soldiers stopped the protest, killing more than fifty women in the process.
      Not surprisingly in contemporary Nigeria, the Aba Women are considered
      to be national heroes! </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Nationalism and Independence</h2>
  <p>World War II (1939-1945) had an important effect on Africa. Some important
    battles were fought in North Africa. Many Africans from French and British
    colonies were also recruited to fight for the Allies in Europe, Asia, and
    North Africa. In recruiting African soldiers, the British and French emphasized
    that soldiers would be helping protect the world against the evils of Fascism
    and Nazism. At the end of the war, the returning soldiers asked an important
    question,"Why should I give my life to keep Europe and America free, when
    I am not free in my own country?" To the ordinary African, life as a colonial
    subject was hardly better than life under Fascism or Nazism. </p>
  <p>Moreover, returning veterans and other Africans were also aware of the promise
    made by the <i>Atlantic Charter</i>. In 1941, the British Prime Minister,
    Winston Churchill, and the U.S. President, Franklin Roosevelt, composed a
    document, the <i>Atlantic Charter</i>, which stated the principles that directed
    the Allies' war effort. The third paragraph of the Charter states that the
    Allies "<i>respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government
    under which they will live; and they will wish to see sovereign rights of
    self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them.</i>" Not
    surprisingly, Africans claimed this as a commitment on the part of the Allies
    (at least Britain) to end colonial rule in Africa. </p>
  <p>Great changes were taking place in other parts of the world in the immediate
    post war period. European colonies in Asia demanded and earned independence
    from Europe. Of particular importance was the independence of India and Pakistan
    from Britain in 1947. Many Africans looked at India as an example of what
    was politically possible for their own countries. </p>
  <p>In the late 1940s and early 1950s, new <i>mass-based</i> political parties
    were formed in almost every African colony. Unlike earlier political organizations,
    these parties were not restricted to the educated elite. They wanted and
    needed mass support for their cause. The <i>cause</i> went beyond the demand
    for more opportunity and an end of discrimination. The central demand was
    for political freedom, for end of colonial rule! The rapid growth of African
    nationalism took European colonial powers by surprise. The Italians and the
    British, followed by the French and then by the reluctant Belgians, eventually
    responded to the demands for independence. </p>
  <p>Libya (1951) and Egypt (1952) were the first African nations to gain independence.
    Ghana (Gold Coast) in 1957 was the first country south of the Sahara to become
    independence. 1960 was the big year for African independence. As indicated
    on the attached map (<b><a 
href="../../../images/decolinization.jpg">Click on Map: African Independence</a></b>),
    fourteen African countries gained their independence in 1960. By 1966, all
    but six African countries were independent nation-states. </p>
  <p>While the movement to independence after the war was quite rapid, it did
    not occur without struggle. Fortunately, in most of the countries that won
    their independence by 1966, the struggle was mainly non-violent. Unfortunately,
    this was not the case for the six remaining African colonies. </p>
  <h2>Struggles for National Liberation</h2>
  <p>At the end of the 1960s, six African colonies remained. Of the six, five
    were settler colonies, that is colonies in which the interests power of the
    European settler community kept the majority African populations from gaining
    their political freedom. Of these six countries, five were in Southern Africa:
    Angola (Portugal/settler) Mozambique (Portugal/settler), Namibia (South Africa/settler),
    South Africa (settler) and Zimbabwe (British/settler). The small Portuguese
    colony of Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde in West Africa was the sixth colony. </p>
  <p>Just as in other African colonies, African nationalist movements had formed
    in each of these countries in the 1940s and 1950s. These political parties
    sought peaceful, constitutional change. That is, the primary aim of the nationalist
    parties was to change the constitutions of the settler colonies to recognize
    the rights of the majority African population. One of the popular slogans
    of these parties was the demand for <i>One Man, One Vote</i>. Does this political
    demand sound familiar? It should! It is similar to the demands made over
    200 years ago by the leaders of the American Revolution. </p>
  <p>For many years, the white settlers in these colonies had the right to vote.
    They used this vote to elect representatives who passed laws that protected
    the power of the European settlers and discriminated against Africans. African
    nationalist leaders believed that if <i>franchise</i> was the right of all
    citizens, the majority population would use their vote to bring in majority,
    independent African rule.</p>
  <p>The settler colonial governments responded to the non-violent constitutional
    demands of African nationalist parties with laws that banned all political
    protests and with violence. Repressive legislation allowed the settler governments
    to arrest and imprison the leaders of the banned African political parties.
    The most famous of the imprisoned political leaders is Nelson Mandela, the
    leader of the <i>African National Congress of South Africa</i>, who spent
    twenty-seven years in jail before being released in 1989. In 1994, he became
    the first president of an independent South Africa. However, Mandela was
    just one of many African leaders who spent years in jail as a result of their
    demands for freedom, majority rule, and independence for their countries. </p>
  <p><img height="158" src="../../../images/mandela.jpg" 
width="144" /></p>
  <p><i>Nelson Mandela</i></p>
  <p>How did the African nationalist political parties respond to the imprisonment
    of their leaders and the banning of all political activities? Their reaction
    was very similar to that of the Americans more than 200 years ago. Just like
    the leaders of the American Revolution, African nationalists decided that
    the only way deal with repressive regimes that used force and violence was
    to resist with force. Beginning in the early 1960s, banned nationalist parties
    in each settler colony transformed themselves into <i>liberation movements</i> for
    armed struggle against the settler regimes. </p>
  <p>This transition to the armed struggle was not an easy one. The armed forces
    of the settler regimes were well equipped and well trained. For their part,
    the newly formed liberation movements had little money to purchase weapons
    and to train their soldiers. Moreover, when the liberation movements sought
    help from the outside world, neither the United States nor the former colonial
    powers in Europe were willing to give support. Were did the support come
    from? Primarily from the China, the former Soviet Union and their allies
    in the <i>Eastern Bloc</i>. <i><a href="../m10/">Module Ten: African Politics
    and Government</a> </i>provides details of how the Cold War (1945-1990) between
    the United States and her allies (<i>Western Bloc</i>) and the Soviet Union
    and her allies (<i>Eastern Bloc</i>) affected the movements for liberation
    in Southern Africa. </p>
  <p>In addition to support from the <i>Eastern Bloc</i>, the liberation movements
    in Southern Africa received strong support from independent African nations.
    In 1963 at the meeting of African leaders that formed the <i>Organization
    of African Unity</i> (<a href="../m10/"><i>Module Ten: African Politics and
    Government</i></a>), Kwame Nkrumah, the highly respected president of Ghana,
    declared that "no African will be free until <i>all Africans are free</i>." While
    the O.A.U. and most African nations supported the liberation struggle in
    Southern Africa, the most direct support came from the <i>Front Line States</i>,
    the independent African countries bordering Southern Africa. These states
    provided some monetary assistance, but most importantly, they provided military
    bases for training and from which the liberation movements could stage attacks.
    Angola, Mozambique, and Zambia suffered attacks from settler regimes because
    of this assistance. </p>
  <p>Although it took many years of struggle, sacrifice, and suffering, all of
    the settler colonies won their independence. South Africa in 1994 became
    the last African colony to achieve majority rule. </p>
  <p>The following table provides information on the struggle in each country.</p>

  <h2>Your Turn:</h2>
  <p><b>Writing Exercise:</b> Complete ONE of the following TWO writing assignments.
    When your teacher has returned your completed assignment, please put it in
    your <i>Exploring Africa Web Journal</i>. </p>
  <p>1. The history of modern Africa has some similarities with the history of
    the United States. The U.S. was a colony of a European power, so were all
    Africa countries with the exception of Ethiopia and Liberia. Based on the
    information provided in the last three learning activities of this module
    and what you have already learned about the history of the colonial era in
    the U.S. history, write a short essay in which you compare and contrast the
    colonial experiences in the United States and Africa. </p>
  <p>2. Pretend that you are a newspaper reporter. Your assignment is to cover
    the nationalist movement in an African country (you get to chose which country!).
    Using information collected from one of the web-sites listed below or from
    encyclopedias in your school library, write a newspaper report in which you
    describe the struggle for independence in the country that you have selected.
    To help you think about what an international report from an African country
    might be like, you could read an international feature article in U.S. newspaper.
    You can do this by going to your school library or by visiting a newspaper
    web-site (the websites of important U.S. newspapers are listed on the <a 
href="../../events/index.php"><i>Exploring Africa Current Events</i></a> page.</p>
  <p>One of the most comprehensive web-resources on individual countries can
    be found on The Library of Congress Country Studies site:</p>
  <p><a 
href="http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/cshome.htm">http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/cshome.html</a></p>
  <p>Another good web-resource for the history of Africa, including the history
    of independence movements, has been produced by the British Broadcasting
    Corporation. Their website <i>The Story of Africa</i> can be found at:</p>
  <p><a 
href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/</a></p>
  <p>Once you have identified your country, you should also do a web-search for
    historical information on your country. Use a one of the standard search
    engines and type in your topic, for example "history of Ghana." It is almost
    certain that you will find one or more sites that have information on the
    struggle for independence in the country that you have selected.</p>

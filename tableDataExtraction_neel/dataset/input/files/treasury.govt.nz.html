		<p>Net national saving rates have been both volatile and display a long term declining trend in most countries. Norway and Ireland were exceptions to this. An overall picture can be obtained by taking the long term average savings rates. These are shown in Table 7. There is a great deal of variation across countries. However, New Zealand has the lowest long term average savings rates, both for net national and household saving. Our gross national saving figure is more similar to other countries, and is possibly a better comparator, as methods of calculating depreciation can differ across countries, and rely on relatively arbitrary assumptions. The United Kingdom, Ireland and Finland are the only countries with similarly low household saving rates; however their long term average rates are all positive in contrast to the negative value for New Zealand. </p>

This paper presents a social accounting model to examine the entrants, exits and transitions of individuals among a wide range of benefit categories in New Zealand. Transition rates and flows are estimated separately for periods before the global financial crisis (GFC) and periods following the crisis. The data were obtained from the Benefit Dynamics Dataset maintained by the Ministry of Social Development. The model is used to examine, using simulations, the implications for the time profile of changes in the stock of benefit recipients under a range of counterfactual situations. It is suggested that the model can provide a useful tool for policy analysis.">

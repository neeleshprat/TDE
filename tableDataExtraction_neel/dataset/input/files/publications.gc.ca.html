Although the rate of growth in private-sector spending in health care         was decreasing in the 1960s and 1970s, it began to exceed public-sector         spending in many countries, including Canada, in the 1980s and 1990s.&nbsp;         There is now greater involvement by the private sector in health care.&nbsp;         Increasingly, the public and private sectors are working conjointly to         fund and deliver health services.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">This paper will examine         public- and private-sector involvement in health care in the member countries         of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).&nbsp;         Using examples from the OECD countries, the first part of the paper discusses         the organization of health-care systems and the role of the public and         private sectors in financing and delivering health care.&nbsp; Following         a few remarks about the comparative method of analysis, the second part         of the paper provides an overview of health-care spending in OECD countries         from 1960 to the present. &nbsp; The next sections examine health-care         financing, delivery and resource allocation in OECD countries with a particular         focus on the increasing involvement of the private sector.&nbsp; After         a section on expectations for the future, the paper makes some concluding         remarks.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="DEFINING &quot;PUBLIC&quot;

For example, even when hospital services are delivered         by charitable organizations (the private sector), the responsibility to         do so is typically delegated by the government (the public sector).&nbsp;         Governments frequently regulate private-sector involvement, as with the         German Sickness Funds, or they may provide additional funding, as with         the substantial government (public) subsidization of the U.S. health-care         system, which is typically described as private.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="THE ROLE OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN HEALTH CARE(txt)" href="#THE ROLE OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN HEALTH CARE"><strong>THE         ROLE OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN HEALTH CARE</strong></a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Public-sector involvement         in health care dates back to 1883 when compulsory sickness insurance was         introduced in Germany for some categories of workers. &nbsp; This established         the first model of mandatory health-care insurance in the Western world.&nbsp;         Almost all industrialized countries now have health-care systems in which         there is a high level of public-sector involvement.&nbsp; Nonetheless,         there is little consensus between economists about the precise role that         the public sector should play in financing and delivering health care.&nbsp;         Some of the arguments for public-sector involvement in health care include         social justice, restriction of monopolies, redistribution and public goods.<a name="(3)txt" href="bp438-e.htm#(3)">(3)</a>         These arguments may overlap.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The social justice argument         applies to situations in which the provision of health services to one         person is advantageous for other members of society.&nbsp; For example,         the treatment of an infectious disease provides a broad societal benefit.         &nbsp; From a social standpoint, public-sector delivery of these types         of health services may be preferred to private-sector delivery because         when the price of a service is determined privately, it may not incorporate         the positive external social benefits of delivering it.&nbsp; As a result,         the price may be higher when it is determined privately.&nbsp; If the         price exceeds what people can afford, or are willing, to pay, they will         forego the treatment.&nbsp; This may have undesirable social consequences.&nbsp;         For example, an infectious disease may spread to a broad segment of society.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The second argument is that         government involvement in health care prevents health-care providers from         exercising a monopoly.&nbsp; In a health-care monopoly, the medical profession         is able to control access to training or impose restrictions on medical         substitutes.&nbsp; This can restrict the availability of services.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The redistribution argument         asserts that public-sector involvement permits the redistribution of funds         from people who are in good health to people who are in poor health.&nbsp;         Individuals are not equally afflicted with health problems.&nbsp; People         with unhealthy lifestyles or dangerous jobs, for example, have a higher         risk of developing health problems.&nbsp; In a private insurance system,         these people would pay a higher premium, but in a public insurance system,         the risks are pooled and everyone pays the same premium, regardless of         the risk for filing a claim.&nbsp; In the public model, insurance must         be mandatory, otherwise those at low risk would almost certainly opt out.&nbsp;         In the private model, insurance is voluntary and insurers may choose who         they wish to insure.&nbsp; In some cases, people in poor health may have         difficulty finding an insurer who is willing to cover them.&nbsp; Figure         1 depicts the health-care funding, risk pooling, and insurance coverage         patterns in selected countries.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><b></b><font face="Times New Roman">The public goods         argument in favour of public-sector involvement in health care suggests         that health care is a public good in the sense that it &#147;cannot be         managed by market mechanisms because it is impossible to exclude people         who have not paid from consuming it.&#148;<a name="(4)txt" href="#(4)">(4)</a>         Clean air and military defence are two other examples of public goods.

Table 2 illustrates the possible combinations for public- and         private-sector involvement in financing and delivering health care, drawing         on examples from the OECD countries.&nbsp; A more detailed discussion         of these options follows.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The precise organization         of a health-care system is much more complex than Table 2 implies.&nbsp;

Tax-based Financing</strong></a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In a tax-based model, access         to health services is, in theory, independent of one&#146;s ability to         pay.&nbsp; In this model, health care is financed primarily through taxation;         and everyone enjoys the same level of public coverage, regardless of their         risk factors and level of taxation.&nbsp; Taxes are collected by the government,         which then delivers the services, as in Sweden, or pays others to do so,         as in Canada. Typically in these systems, no user charges are collected         for publicly insured health services.&nbsp; Even in tax-based schemes,         however, there are some financing variations.&nbsp; For example, New Zealand         uses general tax revenues to finance its system, but in Australia, the         National Health Insurance is funded through a mixture of general tax revenue,         a levy on taxable income, state revenues, and fees paid by patients.&nbsp;         In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service is funded through a         mixture of general taxation and national insurance contributions. Other         countries that use tax-based financing as the primary source of health-care         funding are Denmark, Finland and Ireland.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         <a name="2.

Private Financing</strong></a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Essentially, there are two         categories of private financing: (1) private insurance; and (2) out-of-pocket         payments. The latter category includes several forms of private payment.&nbsp;         For example, in private insurance schemes, co-insurance and deductibles         are types of out-of-pocket payments.<a name="(9)txt" href="bp438-e.htm#(9)">(9)</a>         In public insurance schemes, out-of-pocket payments may include extra         billing or user fees.<a name="(10)txt" href="bp438-e.htm#(10)">(10)</a>         A final type of out-of-pocket payment occurs when services are partially         covered, or not covered at all, by either the public or private insurance         plan.&nbsp; In these cases, the patients must pay the full cost of the         health service.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Although some type of private         financing is used in all OECD countries, the revenue generated in this         way remains a small portion of total health-care spending, except in the         United States where private financing is significant.&nbsp; Nonetheless,         some observers have noted that with the recent emphasis on cost-effectiveness,         these methods of financing have become increasingly common.<a name="(11)txt" href="bp438-e.htm#(11)">(11)</a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Indeed, some health economists         assert that if individuals are required to pay directly for a portion         of their own health services, they will take steps to prevent illness         and their use of health services. &nbsp; As such, it is believed that         private financing will reduce incidences of under-prevention or overuse.         For example, dental care is not covered under Canada&#146;s public health-care         system.&nbsp; This may encourage people to develop better oral hygiene.&nbsp;         Limiting the number of eye examinations covered under the public plan,         as in Canada, restricts the availability of this service and reduces costs,         although perhaps not to the benefit of patients&#146; health.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Some observers, however,         contest this application of economic theory to health care, noting &#147;free-of-charge         services do not translate automatically into unjustified over-utilization         of services.&#148;<a name="(12)txt" href="bp438-e.htm#(12)">(12)</a> In         the first place, they argue that it is unlikely that people will &#147;abuse         their health solely because they will not have to pay for resulting care.&#148;<a name="(13)txt" href="bp438-e.htm#(13)">(13)</a>         Second, they suggest that these arrangements disproportionately affect         the poor.&nbsp; In their view, there is a correlation between poverty         and poor health; the poor require health care more frequently, and they         are less able to pay for the services out of their own pockets. &nbsp;         For this reason, many countries exempt low-income earners from cost-sharing         arrangements.&nbsp; This is the case in the United States where Medicare         and Medicaid provide coverage for the elderly and the poor.&nbsp; Despite         public coverage for these groups of people, it is estimated that &#147;around         60 percent of those below the federally defined poverty line are ineligible&#148;         for coverage in the United States.<a name="(14)txt" href="bp438-e.htm#(14)">(14)</a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         <a name="1.

In Germany, patients are assessed a fee, approximately         $15 Canadian, for hospitalization.&nbsp; In Japan, co-payments are charged         for all medical bills, physicians&#146; bills, inpatient care, pathology,         pharmaceuticals and X-rays, although various government subsidies exist         and fees are adjusted based on income.&nbsp; Extra billing is not common         in OECD countries. Australia and Finland do permit this practice, but         with protections for low-income families.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The highest out-of-pocket         payments are incurred when there is no form of insurance to cover the         cost of health services.&nbsp; In these cases, patients pay for the service         in its entirety.&nbsp; For example, although Canadians do not incur any         out-of-pocket payments for publicly insured health services, certain services         &#150; dental care, eye care and prescription drugs &#150; are not publicly         insured.&nbsp; It has been estimated that approximately 12% of Canadians         do not have a drug insurance plan and therefore must pay the full cost         of their prescription drugs.&nbsp; In 1999, in the United States, some         44 million people &#150; 16% of the population &#150; did not have health-care         coverage.<a name="(15)txt" href="bp438-e.htm#(15)">(15)</a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="C.

        As there is no &#147;laboratory&#148; in which to test new social policy         ideas, the practices and policies of other countries have at times been         used to generate domestic policy. &nbsp; Nonetheless, as Marmor and Okma         point out, &#147;there is much ill-advised &#145;cross-border shopping.&#146;&nbsp;&#148;<a name="(17)txt" href="bp438-e.htm#(17)">(17)</a>         Therefore, comparative analyses should be interpreted and used with caution.&nbsp;

When compiling health-care         data, countries may use different methods to report, record and calculate         these figures.&nbsp; Not only may countries differ in terms of the items         that they exclude and include in their reports, but the way that variables         are defined may differ as well.&nbsp;

In general,         health-care expenditures increase as GDP increases.&nbsp; However, caution         is advised.&nbsp; For example, if one examines health-care expenditures         as a proportion of GDP during a recession, there is the <i>illusion </i>of         growth. &nbsp; This is because during times of economic recession, health-care         expenditures remain relatively stable while GDP decreases, making it appear         as though there has been growth in health-care spending.&nbsp; Nonetheless,         the relationship between health-care expenditures and GDP is the most         commonly used comparator. It would be inappropriate, and difficult, to         define a &#147;correct&#148; level of health-care funding, but the World         Health Organization suggests that &#147;while spending much more than         9% of GDP may indicate macroeconomic inefficiency, countries spending         less than 2% are almost certainly investing too little in health.&#148;<a name="(18)txt" href="bp438-e.htm#(18)">(18)</a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Table 3 shows the level         of health-care spending as a proportion of GDP in OECD countries.&nbsp;         When examining total health-care expenditures, two trends are apparent.&nbsp;         First, in the 1960s and 1970s, spending on health care increased dramatically         in most OECD countries.&nbsp; Second, throughout the 1980s and 1990s,         health-care spending slowed, or decreased, in most countries.&nbsp; Indeed,         between 1960 and 1980, health-care spending as a proportion of GDP grew         by 2.9 percentage points; between 1980 and 1998, health-care spending         as a proportion of GDP grew by only 1.4 percentage points, half the rate         of growth experienced in the previous two decades.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In Canada, the rate of growth         in health-care spending was the fastest in the 1960s and 1980s; it was         slower in the 1970s and the 1990s.&nbsp; In the late 1990s, health-care         spending as a proportion of GDP has changed only marginally in relation         to GDP.&nbsp; This is consistent with most other OECD countries.&nbsp;         Even in the United States, where health-care spending in relation to GDP         has been increasing since the 1960s, between 1995 and 1999, health-care         spending declined in relation to GDP. &nbsp; Clearly, cost control has         become a key plank in the health-care policies of most OECD countries.</font></p>      <p

spending in all OECD countries increased dramatically, as did government         involvement in health care. As Table 4 shows, in the OECD countries for         which sufficient data exist, public spending on health care (as a proportion         of GDP) increased 2.8 percentage points between 1960 and 1980, while private-sector         spending increased by only 0.2 percentage point in the same period.&nbsp;         In Canada, the comparison is even more striking: while public spending         increased by 3.1 percentage points between 1960 and 1980, private spending         decreased 1.3 percentage points and did not begin to rise again until         the 1980s. &nbsp;&nbsp; The strong growth in health-care spending in Canada         and elsewhere during the 1960s was largely a result of growth in the public         sector.</font></p>      <p align="center"><font face="Times New

deterioration of public finances resulted in decreasing growth         in public health-care spending in the 1970s and 1980s in many countries.&nbsp;         This decline in the rate of growth of public financing was accompanied         by growth in private-sector financing, a trend that has continued in the         1990s.&nbsp; Between 1960 and 1980, private-sector spending on health         care as a proportion of GDP increased by 0.2 percentage point; from 1980         to 1998, private-sector spending on health as a proportion of GDP increased         by 0.5&nbsp;percentage point.&nbsp; In Canada, private-sector spending         as a proportion of GDP decreased during the 1960s and 1970s, but it increased         during the 1980s and 1990s.&nbsp; This is shown in Table 5.</font></p>

This is illustrated         in Figure 2, which shows the proportion of health-care financing that         comes from tax revenues, social security, and private insurance and other         out-of-pocket payments.&nbsp; Public financing, through taxation and social         security, is the primary source of funding for health care in seven of         the eight countries shown, but private-sector contributions are used to         finance health care in all of these countries.&nbsp; Private-sector financing         as a proportion of all health-care funding is the highest in the United         States and the lowest in the United Kingdom and Japan.</font></p>      <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Figure 2<br>        Proportion of Health-Care Funding Generated by Different Methods in<br>        Selected Countries, 1998</b></font></p>      <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="../images/bp438e-2.jpg" alt="bp438e-3.jpg (34076 bytes)" WIDTH="700" HEIGHT="331"></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerard         F.

Some of the measures that have been introduced include         spending controls, budget limits on expenditures for new hospitals and         expensive equipment, restrictions on the number of medical staff, and         decreased volume of services.&nbsp; No two countries have adopted identical         policies, but each of these reforms has one thing in common:&nbsp; they         shift some of the responsibility for health-care funding and delivery         away from the public sector and on to the private sector.<a name="(19)txt" href="bp438-e.htm#(19)">(19)</a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Indeed, in her analysis         of OECD countries in 1996, Susan MacPhee found that in the past two decades         &#147;most countries have altered the ways health care dollars are spent         rather than how they are raised.&#148;<a name="(20)txt" href="bp438-e.htm#(20)">(20)</a>         She notes that major financing reforms have not been undertaken, or have         been slow-moving, in most countries because of concerns about accessibility         and the political implications of doing so.&nbsp; In order to maintain         current levels of services, without significantly reforming health-care         financing or increasing public funding, cost shifting has become a common         strategy in OECD countries.&nbsp; Cost shifting can occur between the         public and the private sectors, or between levels of government. In general,         the cost-shifting initiatives that have been adopted in OECD countries         have been on the delivery side of health care, rather than the financing         side.&nbsp; Nevertheless, some countries have used strategies to shift         costs on the financing side.&nbsp; These include increases to out-of-pocket         payments, greater reliance on private insurance, and reducing public coverage         of health services. </font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Out-of-pocket payments &#150;

<i>International Social         Security Review</i> 51.1 (1998), pp. 112-113.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Although out-of-pocket payments         are usually introduced to reduce public spending in health care, there         is little evidence that they are an effective strategy for reducing total         spending on health care.&nbsp; The assumption behind out-of-pocket payments         is that they will decrease the use of health services, but as noted previously,         this is open to debate.&nbsp; Moreover, some observers argue that multiple-payer         systems, such as those that charge out-of-pocket fees, are less efficient         than single-payer systems, such as those financed solely through government         funding.<a name="(21)txt" href="bp438-e.htm#(21)">(21)</a> If the use         of health services remains relatively stable and costs are charged directly         to the patients, the overall cost of health care may increase, rather         than decrease.&nbsp; Alternatively, if patients forego necessary treatment         because they do not wish to pay directly for the service, greater costs         may be incurred to treat the condition later on.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In addition, charging patients         directly for services may increase administrative costs.&nbsp; For example,         in New Zealand, user fees were set so high that people simply refused         to pay their medical bills; the government was forced to lower the fees         in the face of high collection costs.<a name="(22)txt" href="bp438-e.htm#(22)">(22)</a>         In Italy, to avoid paying user fees, patients will ask to be hospitalized         because medication and diagnostic tests are free in Italian hospitals.<a name="(23)txt" href="bp438-e.htm#(23)">(23)</a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A second way that countries         have shifted costs from the public sector to the private sector is to         decrease public coverage of health services.&nbsp; Services no longer         covered under the public plan must be paid for either through private         insurance or out of the patient&#146;s own pocket.&nbsp; In some cases,         the treatment will be foregone altogether.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">As this section has shown,         health-care financing continues to be carried out primarily by the public         sector, but private-sector financing has increased significantly in the         past 20 years.&nbsp; According to some analysts, private-sector spending         on health care in OECD countries may increase further in the coming years         because of further reductions in public-sector spending, as well as demographic         changes.&nbsp; In most OECD countries, the population aged 65 years and         older is increasing, as is the average income among those in this age         bracket.&nbsp; According to the OECD, per capita health-care expenditures         for those 70 years of age and older are approximately double the average         per capita health-care expenditures; expenditures for those 80 years of         age and older are about four times higher than the average.<a name="(24)txt" href="bp438-e.htm#(24)">(24)</a>         Moreover, the marginal propensity to use health care increases with income.<a name="(25)txt" href="bp438-e.htm#(25)">(25)</a>         As the population of the over-65 age group increases and grows wealthier,         the demand for health care will increase.&nbsp; This demand could be met         by increasing the involvement of the private sector in financing and delivering         health care.&nbsp; Other analysts believe that improving the efficiency         and effectiveness of publicly funded health care is the best means of         addressing the pressures of an aging population.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="DELIVERING HEALTH CARE IN OECD COUNTRIES(txt)" href="#DELIVERING HEALTH CARE IN OECD COUNTRIES"><strong>DELIVERING         HEALTH CARE IN OECD COUNTRIES</strong></a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">As previously noted, significant         reforms have been made to the ways in which countries deliver their health         services.&nbsp; MacPhee suggests that these reforms have typically translated         into greater private-sector involvement, with increased private delivery         of health services being one of the most common strategies.<a name="(26)txt" href="#(26)">(26)</a>         The trend toward increased private delivery is based on two assumptions.&nbsp;         First, in health-care systems that are publicly financed and publicly         delivered, consumer choice and satisfaction are believed to be low.&nbsp;         Second, current health economics theory posits that competitive markets         create greater monetary efficiency in health-care systems.&nbsp; As a         result, most countries have attempted to promote greater micro-economic         efficiency in their health-care systems.<a name="(27)txt" href="#(27)">(27)</a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Although the Scandinavian         countries have maintained publicly financed and publicly delivered health-care         systems (often called &#147;integrated systems&#148;), many countries         are moving to public-contract or reimbursement systems that combine public         financing with private delivery.&nbsp; This type of system is used in         Canada, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and most of the countries that         have emerged from the former Soviet Union, among others.<a name="(28)txt" href="#(28)">(28)</a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In addition, certain countries         are moving away from an institutionalized approach to health care. Because         hospital expenditures comprise a large portion of overall health-care         spending, many countries are attempting to decrease hospitalization rates         and the length of hospital stays. In general, this has affected the way         that health care is delivered, with an increased emphasis on ambulatory         care and outpatient care, as well as shifting responsibility for long-term         care from hospitals to patients and their families.<a name="(29)txt" href="#(29)">(29)</a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="RESOURCE ALLOCATION: SERVICE RATIONING(txt)" href="#RESOURCE ALLOCATION: SERVICE RATIONING"><strong>RESOURCE         ALLOCATION: SERVICE RATIONING</strong></a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to the financing         and delivery reforms introduced to promote greater efficiency, some countries         have changed the way in which resources are allocated, a strategy that         is often referred to as rationing. The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,         Sweden and the United States are some of the OECD countries that have         introduced rationing mechanisms into their health-care systems.<a name="(30)txt" href="#(30)">(30)</a>         Rationing may take several forms.&nbsp; In some cases, the government         will give each hospital a budget, with penalties for budget overruns and         the imposition of measures to prevent the reallocation of revenue.&nbsp;         In other cases, limits are placed on the number of new hospitals or efforts         are made to discourage the proliferation of expensive medical equipment.&nbsp;         Finally, direct controls may be applied to the number of staff, the volume         of service, and rates of pay.<a name="(31)txt" href="#(31)">(31)</a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">These measures force health-care         workers to operate using limited resources.&nbsp; In so doing, they attempt         to improve the allocation of resources and to deliver health services         more efficiently.&nbsp; In some countries, the limitation of services         tended to shift demand and expenditures to service points with fewer restrictions.&nbsp;         For example, in Canada and France, where physicians are paid by procedure,         the cost of outpatient care has increased primarily because of the constraints         on hospital spending.&nbsp; In other countries, where regulations permitted,         budget constraints shifted the demand for health care to the private sector         which, in some cases, spurred the growth of the private insurance market.<a name="(32)txt" href="#(32)">(32)</a>         In Canada, private insurers offered Canadians health insurance so that         they could get non-emergency care outside of the country.<a name="(33)txt" href="#(33)">(33)</a>         In many countries, rationing has created increased waiting times.<a name="(34)txt" href="#(34)">(34)</a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Although rationing may decrease         public spending on health care, there are indirect private costs associated         with this practice.&nbsp; These include the discomfort a person feels         while awaiting treatment, the economic losses incurred when a person is         unable to work for an extended period while awaiting treatment, and the         increased travel costs incurred as a result of decreases in the number         of service points.<a name="(35)txt" href="#(35)">(35)</a> When health         care is rationed, private costs are unpredictable and it is therefore         difficult to determine the overall cost of health care.&nbsp; As a result         of rationing, a country&#146;s real health-care spending may be underestimated         and this can skew international comparisons.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, some observers         have suggested that rationing is both subjective and economically less         effective than other forms of allocation.&nbsp;&nbsp; As there is no way         of determining the optimal level of health-care spending in any country,<a name="(36)txt" href="#(36)">(36)</a>         resource allocation &#150; in a context of rationing &#150; is arbitrary.&nbsp;         For example, front-line physicians will determine which patients should         be treated and, in the absence of clear selection criteria, they may reject         patients with fewer chances of suffering ill effects if they are not treated.<a name="(37)txt" href="#(37)">(37)</a>         Similarly, when purchasing new equipment, hospital administrators may         be forced to choose a dialysis machine over a magnetic resonance imaging         unit (MRI).&nbsp; If the dialysis machine is chosen, patients requiring         MRIs will have to travel elsewhere, or be subjected to longer wait times.&nbsp;         If the MRI is chosen, those requiring dialysis will suffer.&nbsp; The         choice is highly subjective.&nbsp; Rationed allocation is therefore problematic.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="WHAT CAN WE EXPECT IN THE FUTURE?(txt)" href="#WHAT CAN WE EXPECT IN THE FUTURE?"><strong>WHAT         CAN WE EXPECT IN THE FUTURE?</strong></a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Although controlling health-care         costs and maintaining equitable access to services will likely remain         important policy goals in most OECD countries, we can expect to see increased         emphasis on health-care quality and illness prevention in the future.&nbsp;         In a survey of OECD countries in 1996, it was found that &#147;while cost         containment remained an issue for most countries, countries&#146; emphasis         on customer satisfaction, equity of health status, and promotion of a         healthy lifestyle showed that these issues have become important to member         countries as well.&#148;<a name="(38)txt" href="#(38)">(38)</a> In general,         countries have realized that cost containment, on its own, can adversely         affect the quality of health care.<a name="(39)txt" href="#(39)">(39)</a>         In addition, countries are beginning to recognize the long-term benefits         that are derived from the maintenance of quality health services, the         promotion of healthy lifestyles, and the prevention of future illnesses.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">For example, many OECD countries         have, or are in the process of developing, performance standards and quality         assurance programs to ensure the quality of health-care systems.&nbsp;         Australia, Canada, France, Mexico, Belgium, Denmark, Austria, Sweden,         the United Kingdom and the United States all have such programs.&nbsp;         Some countries now link the quality of health services to the reimbursement         of costs.&nbsp; This may include financial incentives to increase quality,         as in France, or introducing quality as a variable when awarding service         contracts, as in Italy.<a name="(40)txt" href="#(40)">(40)</a> Many countries         have implemented strategies to encourage healthier living, as in France         and Canada, which have developed educational initiatives to combat substance         abuse among teenagers.<a name="(41)txt" href="#(41)">(41)</a> Other countries         are taking steps to prevent illnesses, as in Hungary and Poland, where         concerns about the long-term health effects of pollution and poor water         quality have prompted efforts to improve the environment.&nbsp; Other         countries, such as Canada and the United States, have improved screening         programs for breast cancer to promote early detection.<a name="(42)txt" href="#(42)">(42)</a></font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Key future health-care concerns         are likely to be focused on:&nbsp; containing costs; maintaining accessibility;         and ensuring quality.&nbsp; To address these concerns, private-sector         involvement in health-care systems will undoubtedly continue in the future         and, as noted, this involvement may increase.</font></p>      <b>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="CONCLUSIONtxt" href="bp438-e.htm#CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION</a></font></p>      </b>       <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The 1960s and 1970s were         a period of health-care socialization in OECD countries, while the 1980s         and 1990s were a period of health-care privatization.&nbsp; Increased         private-sector involvement in health care has been achieved through cost         containment strategies, delivery reforms and new methods of allocation.&nbsp;         In general, private financing has increased, while access to some services         has decreased.</font></p>      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">High public debt, the desire         for efficiency, and an aging population have all contributed to the increased         reliance on private-sector resources for financing and delivering health         care.&nbsp; In the future, we will likely see an increased emphasis on         promoting healthy lifestyles, preventing illnesses, and maintaining the         quality of health-care systems in OECD countries. &nbsp; Addressing these         objectives while maintaining costs in the face of increasing demands will         likely require even greater private-sector involvement in health-care         systems.&nbsp; As a result, we are likely to see further government withdrawal         from the health-care sector in most OECD countries, a trend that is consistent         with government withdrawal from other sectors.</font></p>      <hr noshade>      <font SIZE="3">      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="(1)" href="bp438-e.htm#(1)txt">(1)</a>         This document is an edited and updated version of <i>Public and Private         Sector Involvement in Health Care Systems:&nbsp;

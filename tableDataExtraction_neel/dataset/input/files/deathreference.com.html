    <p>
      Infant mortality refers to deaths of children under the age of one year.
      It is measured by the infant mortality rate, which is the total number of
      deaths to children under the age of one year for every 1,000 live births.
      The infant mortality rate is often broken down into two components
      relating to timing of death: neonatal and postneonatal. The neonatal
      mortality rate refers to the number of deaths to babies within 28 days
      after birth (per 1,000 live births). Sometimes a special type of neonatal
      mortality is assessed. The perinatal mortality rate measures the number of
      late fetal deaths (at or after 28 weeks gestation) and deaths within the
      first 7 days after birth per 1,000 live births. The postneonatal mortality
      rate involves the number of deaths to babies from 28 days to the end of
      the first year per 1,000 live births. The distinction between neonatal
      (and perinatal) and postneonatal mortality is important because the risk
      of death is higher close to the delivery date, and the causes of death
      near the time of birth/delivery are quite different from those later in
      infancy. Therefore, effective interventions to reduce infant mortality
      need to take into account the distribution of ages at death of infants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many developing countries lack the resources to keep track of infant
      deaths; therefore data for these areas are estimates only. Another
      methodological problem in measuring infant mortality is ascertaining the
      number of live births. Sometimes this problem is one of undercounts of
      births (i.e., births are not registered and thus not counted); sometimes
      the difficulty lies in inconsistently differentiating stillbirths and live
      births, especially across countries because this distinction is not as
      clear-cut as one might imagine.

    <h2>
      Infant Mortality in International Perspective
    </h2>
    <p>
      Table 1 provides infant mortality rates for the world, for developed and
      developing countries, and by continent, with some selected countries that
      highlight the range of levels. At 57, the world&#x0027;s infant mortality
      rate has never been lower; however, differences across the world are
      substantial. Africa&#x0027;s rate (88) is ten times higher than the
      average rate (8) for the developed countries. Within Africa the highest
      levels of infant mortality in the world are experienced, with rates as
      high as 157 in Sierra Leone. On average the rate for Asia (56) is somewhat
      lower than for Africa, but some Asian countries such as Afghanistan have
      rates (150) as high as anywhere in the world. On the other hand, Hong
      Kong&#x0027;s rate (3.2) is very low, illustrating that the most variation
      in infant mortality level occurs in Asia. Both Europe and North America
      (the United States and Canada) have low levels of infant mortality, with
      average rates well under 10. However, European variation is not
      inconsequential; rates in at least some parts of Eastern Europe are nearly
      10 times higher than in northern European countries such as Iceland and
      Sweden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, income and education, both at the societal and individual levels,
      are closely associated with infant mortality. While the relationship
      between infant mortality and level of socioeconomic development is not
      perfect, the infant mortality rate is commonly used more than any other
      measure as a general indicator of socioeconomic wellbeing and of general
      medical and public health

      conditions in a country. Richer countries can provide the basic
      ingredients for infant survival: clean water, sanitary surroundings,
      adequate food and shelter, and access to health care services. A large
      portion of infant mortality is due to infectious and communicable
      diseases, which sanitary practices and an adequate diet do much to
      prevent.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the individual level mothers (and fathers) with higher income and
      education are more likely to possess knowledge of sanitary behaviors and
      the money for adequate food, as well as to take their babies to a health
      service if needed. Especially important in the latter regard is oral
      rehydration therapy, which is effective in saving babies from dying from
      the dehydration that accompanies diarrhea.

    <h2>
      Causes of Infant Deaths
    </h2>
    <p>
      Postneonatal mortality is most often caused by infectious diseases, such
      as pneumonia, tetanus, and malaria. An important factor in reducing
      post-neonatal mortality is adequate nutrition, particularly breast milk,
      which provides babies with both the nourishment and the antibodies to
      fight infectious diseases. Of course adequate breast milk depends upon
      adequately nourished mothers. Also important is the proper use of breast
      milk substitutes&#x2014;mixing formula with unclean water and/or diluting
      formula for cost-savings reasons, both known to occur in developing
      countries, have negative affects on the health of infants. The promotion
      by multinational corporations of breast milk substitutes to women in
      poorer countries has been one of the travesties of our times; it is
      estimated that 1.5 million deaths a year could be prevented by
      breast-feeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The issue of HIV-infected mothers&#x0027; breast-feeding has become
      controversial. A number of countries have instituted policies that
      recommend that mothers with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) not
      breast-feed, based on some evidence of mother-to-child transmission of HIV
      through breast-feeding. In contrast are policies that promote
      breast-feeding in areas with high HIV prevalence. Because breast-feeding
      protects against the infectious diseases that take the lives of millions
      of infants every year, there is policy debate about the best course of
      action. Researchers do not know if the protection against infectious
      diseases afforded by breast-feeding outweighs the risks of HIV
      transmission to children, so it is not possible to make a definitive
      conclusion about the risks and benefits of breast-feeding by mothers with
      HIV. However, a 2000 study by the World Health Organization (WHO)
      Collaborative Study Team on the Role of Breastfeeding on the Prevention of
      Infant Mortality determined that the breast-fed babies of mothers with HIV
      had six times the protection against diarrheal deaths in the first few
      months of life than babies not breast-fed. In the second half-year of
      life, protection against both diarrheal and acute respiratory infections
      was about double that for non-breast-fed babies. Protection declined with
      age of child, and was greatest for the children of the least educated
      women. It appears the benefits may out-weigh the risks for limited (in
      time) breast-feeding and for poorer women, who are unable to afford safe
      substitute milk substitutes. However, another issue to consider is that
      breast-feeding may negatively affect the health of mothers with HIV/AIDS
      (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).
    </p>
    <p>
      Another cause of infant mortality is violence. Research conducted in two
      areas in India show that wife beating, closely linked with patriarchal
      social structures, leads to both pregnancy loss and 
       infant mortality. Other violence, such as infanticide, the deliberate
      killing of infants, is extremely difficult to document, but it seems
      likely that some portion of the &#x0022;missing girls&#x0022; in India and
      China were the victims of infanticide. When infanticide is practiced, it
      is most likely a response to difficult economic circumstances (and
      coercive population policy, in the case of China) in conjunction with
      male-child preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violence against babies is not limited to developing countries. Violence
      to infants in the form of head trauma, including shaken baby syndrome
      (SBS), has been studied in America. In 2000 the researchers Suzanne
      Starling and James Holden found that in both a western and southern U.S.
      sample men are more likely (70 percent) to be perpetrators of violence,
      with biological fathers (not necessarily married to the mother or living
      with the child) the most likely to cause fatal (and nonfatal) head trauma
      to infants, followed by boyfriends. The victims were more likely to be
      boys, with an average age of six months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excluding violence, neonatal mortality (in contrast to postneonatal
      mortality) is less likely to be the direct result of social, economic, and
      environmental conditions. Major causes of neonatal mortality include low
      birthweight, preterm (premature) birth, congenital malformations, and
      sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In developed countries most infant
      mortality is concentrated in the early neonatal period, with the
      aforementioned causes of death predominant.

    <h2>
      Infant Mortality in the United States
    </h2>
    <p>
      Over the course of the twentieth century, each developed country has a
      somewhat unique trend in the timing and tempo of infant mortality decline,
      an examination of the American case provides a general sense of the
      Western pattern. In the early part of the twentieth century, the infant
      mortality rate was in excess of 100&#x2014;much higher than in the
      developing countries (on average) of the twenty-first century. In other
      words, more than 10 percent of children born died in the first year of
      life. In the earlier stage of decline, postneonatal mortality was reduced.
      Over the period from 1915 to around the end of World War II, postneonatal
      mortality experienced a steady and dramatic decline to a level of
      approximately 10 (Wegman 2001). At the same time, deaths of babies from 28
      days to one year of age decreased as a proportion of total infant deaths
      (i.e., all death under the age of one). This decline was due to
      improvements in nutrition and in public health, such as clean drinking
      water, sewage disposal, and personal hygiene. Deaths due to diarrhea and
      infectious diseases such as pneumonia, diphtheria, and typhoid fever were
      reduced dramatically. In the post&#x2013;World War II era, vaccines and
      other medical interventions such as antibiotics played a role in further
      declines. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Neonatal mortality declined more slowly and later than postneonatal
      mortality. It was not until around 1975 that the neonatal rate reached
      10&#x2014;lagging behind neonatal mortality by a generation. Neonatal
      mortality decline is much less dependent on nutrition and public health
      measures; rather, it requires more sophisticated medical interventions,
      especially to keep low birthweight babies alive. In the twenty-first
      century, approximately two-thirds of all infant deaths occur in the
      neonatal period, with the leading causes of death associated with low
      birthweight, congenital malformations, and SIDS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latest data available reveal that the United States&#x0027; rate for
      infant mortality is not as low as one might expect. According to the
      Population Reference Bureau, its rate of 7 is surpassed by several
      European countries (Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Germany, Netherlands,
      Switzerland, and the Czech Republic all have rates under 5), several Asian
      countries (Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan all have rates under 4), Canada
      (5.5), Australia (5.3), and New Zealand (5.5) (Wegman 2001). Countries in
      the 7 to 8 range in infant mortality, along with the United States,
      include Cyprus, Malaysia, and Cuba&#x2014;all considerably less developed
      than the United States. The United States&#x0027; comparatively poor
      ranking in infant mortality has led to concern at the national level,
      especially relating to racial inequalities. The figures for African
      Americans show a consistent disadvantage in infant mortality, a
      disadvantage that is increasing, especially with regard to neonatal
      mortality.
    </p>
    <p>
      An important factor influencing the relationship between race and infant
      mortality is birth-weight. At the end of the twentieth century, 13 percent
      of (non-Hispanic) African-American babies were born in the low birthweight
      category (under 2,500 grams or approximately 5 pounds), compared with
      approximately 6.5 percent of (non-Hispanic) Caucasian babies and Hispanic
      infants. 
       The reasons why African-American women are so much more likely to give
      birth to high-risk, low birthweight infants remain unclear, although
      differences in prenatal care may be implicated, as may the absence of a
      national health care system and inadequate social welfare. Another factor
      to note is that the infant mortality of whites is lowered by the
      contribution of immigrants who have lower infant mortality than the native
      born.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the decade of the 1990s, Caucasian women (and American Indian and
      Asian/Pacific Islander women) experienced some increase in low
      birth-weight babies. This statistic has been attributed in part to an
      increase in multiple births (e.g., twins, triplets), which are more likely
      to be low birth-weight newborns. Increases in multiple births are
      associated with fertility drugs and reproductive technologies such as in
      vitro fertilization and, to some degree, later age at childbearing. This
      increase in low birthweight infants does not bode well for future declines
      in neonatal mortality.
    </p>

    <h2>
      The Future
    </h2>
    <p>
      In developing countries considerable progress against infant mortality,
      especially postneonatal mortality, can be accomplished through the
      implementation of basic public health measures that will reduce infant
      deaths due to diarrhea and infectious disease. However, the HIV/AIDS
      epidemic places some countries, especially sub-Saharan Africa and parts of
      Southeast Asia, in a difficult position since HIV/AIDS kills infants
      directly and, through lowering immune functioning, indirectly. In
      developed countries, the major immediate challenge is to reduce the
      proportion of low birthweight infants. While improved prenatal care will
      advance that goal, restructuring (i.e., dismantling) of welfare states
      presents a possible barrier, as does the continuing popularity of
      technologies to increase fertility. Another unknown factor in all
      countries is the future role of re-emerging old and emerging new viruses
      and pathogenic bacteria; these microbes could significantly increase
      postneonatal mortality.

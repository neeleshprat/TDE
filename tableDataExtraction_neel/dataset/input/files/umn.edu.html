  </span>Introduction</span></font></h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><i><span>Who is a Refugee?</span></i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>People who are forced to flee 
  their homes due to persecution, whether on an individual basis or as part of 
  a mass exodus due to political, religious, military or other problems, are known 
  as <i><a href="#refugee">refugees</a>.</i></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>The definition of a refugee 
  has varied according to time and place, but increased international concern 
  for the plight of refugees has lead to a general consensus. As defined in the 
  <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/v1crs.htm">1951 United Nations 
  Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees</a> (the Refugee Convention), 
  a refugee is defined as a person who </span></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>“owing to a well-founded fear 
    of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership 
    of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country 
    of his nationality, and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is unwilling 
    to avail himself of the protection of that country or return there because 
    there is a fear of persecution...”</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>While the definition in the 
  Refugee Convention has been used by international organizations such as the 
  United Nations, the term continues to be misunderstood and is often used inconsistently 
  in every day language. Media stories, for example, often confuse refugees with 
  people migrating for economic reasons (“<a href="#economicmigrant">economic 
  migrants</a>”) and persecuted groups who remain within their own country and 
  don’t cross an international border (“<a href="#idp">internally displaced persons</a>”). 
  </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>The reasons for persecution 
  must be because of one of the five grounds listed in article 1 A(2) of the Refugee 
  Convention: race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group 
  or political opinion. Persecution based on any other ground will not be considered.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span>Race</span></i><span> is 
  used in the broadest sense and includes ethnic groups and social groups of common 
  descent.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span>Religion</span></i><span> 
  also has a broad meaning, including identification with a group that tends to 
  share common traditions or beliefs, as well as the active practice of religion.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span>Nationality</span></i><span> 
  includes an individual’s citizenship. Persecution of ethnic, linguistic and 
  cultural groups within a population also may be termed persecution based on 
  nationality.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>A <i>particular social group</i> 
  refers to people who share a similar background, habits or social status. This 
  category often overlaps with persecution based on one of the other four grounds. 
  It has applied to families of capitalists, landowners, homosexuals, entrepreneurs 
  and former members of the military.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span>Political opinion</span></i><span> 
  refers to ideas not tolerated by the authorities, including opinions critical 
  of government policies and methods. It includes opinions attributed to individuals 
  (<i>i.e</i>., the authorities think a person has a certain political opinion) 
  even if the individual does not in fact hold that opinion. Individuals who conceal 
  their political opinions until after they have fled their countries may qualify 
  for refugee status if they can show that their views are likely to subject them 
  to persecution if they return home. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>Definitions come into play 
  when countries and organizations attempt to determine who is and who is not 
  a refugee. <a href="#asylumseeker"><em>Asylum seekers</em></a>—that is, those 
  who are seeking refugee status in another country-- normally need to establish 
  individually that their fear of persecution is well-founded and undergo a legal 
  procedure in which the host country decides if she or he qualifies for refugee 
  status. However, during a mass exodus, it may not be possible for a host country 
  to carry out individual screening. In such circumstances, particularly when 
  civilians are fleeing for similar reasons, a 'group' determination of refugee 
  status may be declared, whereby each civilian is considered a refugee, in the 
  absence of evidence to the contrary.</span></font></p>

<p><span>International law recognizes the right to seek asylum, but does not oblige 
  states to provide it. <span>Nations at times offer 'temporary protection' when 
  they face a sudden mass influx of people and their regular asylum systems would 
  be overwhelmed. In such circumstances people can be speedily admitted to safe 
  countries, but without any guarantee of permanent asylum. Thus 'temporary protection' 
  is helpful to both governments and asylum seekers in specific circumstances. 
  Yet it only complements and does not substitute for the wider protection measures 
  offered by the Refugee Convention. </span></span></p>
<p><span>Refugee protection and assistance organizations generally promote three 
  &quot;durable solutions&quot; to the fate of refugees: </span></p>
</font>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="#repatriation"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span>Voluntary 
    repatriation</span></i></font></a><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span> 
    </span></i><span>: refugees are able to return to their home country because 
    their<br>
    lives and liberty are no longer threatened;</span></font></li>
  <li> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span>Local integration</span></i><b><span>: 
    </span></b><span>host governments allow refugees to integrate into the country 
    of first<br>
    asylum; and </span></font></li>
  <li> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span>Resettlement in a third 
    country</span></i><span> : repatriation is unsafe and the first-asylum country 
    refuses local integration. </span></font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>Most of the world's refugees 
  wait for durable solutions for their predicament. While most have been granted 
  provisional or temporary asylum in neighboring countries, they are not able 
  to regularize their status or integrate.  Their rights to move and work are 
  often highly restricted, and educational and recreational opportunities are 
  often nonexistent or severely lacking. These refugees may also be subject to 
  attack, either by local security forces or by cross-border incursions from the 
  country of origin. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>A special category are people 
  who may have been forced to flee their homes for the same reasons as refugees 
  but they have not crossed an international border. These people are called <i><a href="#idp">internally 
  displaced persons</a></i>. By the end of 2000, there were approximately 11.5 
  million refugees around the world who had fled their countries for a variety 
  of reasons and an even greater number of internally displaced persons, between 
  20 – 25 million, who had abandoned their homes for similar reasons. Increasingly 
  the majority of current conflicts in the world involve disputes between political 
  or ethnic groups within countries rather than wars between countries. Given 
  this trend, the number of persons caught up in conflicts in their own countries 
  and forced to leave their homes is likely to increase.</span><br clear=all>

<p><span>Prohibition on the forced return of a refugee is called <i><a href="#refoulement">nonrefoulement</a></i> 
  and is one of the most fundamental principles in international refugee law. 
  This principle is laid out in Article 33 of the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/v1crs.htm">Convention 
  Relating to the Status of Refugees</a>, which says that no state &quot;shall 
  expel or return ('refouler' in French) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to 
  the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on 
  account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social

<p>Some countries detain asylum seekers upon arrival, during the asylum process 
  or while waiting for deportation (<i><a href="#refoulement">refoulement</a></i>). 
  Asylum seekers may have already suffered imprisonment and Torture in the country 
  from which they have fled. Therefore, The consequences of detention may be particularly 
  serious, causing severe emotional and psychological stress. Article 31 of the 
  Refugee Convention says that refugees should not be penalized for having entered 
  a country illegally if they have come directly from a place where they were 
  in danger and have made themselves known to the authorities. Therefore, asylum 
  seekers should not be detained for being in possession of forged identity papers 
  or for destroying identity or travel documents.</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>The following organizations 
  play key roles in assisting and protecting refugees worldwide: </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><span><a href="http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">United 
  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a></span></b><span>. The United Nations 
  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was created in 1951 to assist in the 
  international protection of refugees. <span>The organization’s primary objective 
  is to ensure that all persons can exercise the right to seek asylum and find 
  safe refuge in another state, and to return home voluntarily. One of the agency’s 
  pressing tasks is to encourage governments to adopt fair and flexible processes 
  to promote just and effective refugee law. </span>When UNHCR was first established, 
  material aspects of refugee relief (<i>e.g.,</i> housing, food) were seen to 
  be the responsibility of the government that had granted asylum. As many of 
  the world’s more recent major refugee flows have occurred in less developed 
  countries, however, UNHCR has acquired the additional role of coordinating material 
  assistance for refugees and returnees. Although this was not UNHCR's original 
  mandate, coordination of material assistance has become one of its principal 
  functions alongside protection and the promotion of solutions. <span>The <b><a href="http://www.iom.int">International 
  Organization of Migration (IOM</a></b><a href="http://www.iom.int">)</a> assists 
  with the return of rejected asylum seekers and refugees referred by UNHCR.</span></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><span><a href="http://www.icrc.org/">International 
  Committee of the Red Cross</a>. </span></b><span>The International Committee 
  of the Red Cross (ICRC) is an independent humanitarian organization that acts 
  as a neutral entity in assisting and protecting victims of war, from providing 
  medical care to victims to arranging exchanges of family messages. As members 
  of the civilian population, displaced persons benefit from ICRC protection and 
  assistance activities including the protection of civilians; visits to detainees; 
  medical assistance; food aid; and restoration of family links between persons 
  separated by war. The ICRC does not have a general mandate to provide protection 
  and assistance to internally displaced persons. Over the years, however, it 
  has provided limited assistance to certain groups of internally displaced persons. 
  The ICRC is considered well placed to provide such help given its experience 
  in humanitarian and crisis situations. These operations have been carried out 
  at the request of the UN Secretary-General or the General Assembly, at the request 
  of the country involved. <b><br>

  <br>
  <a name="iii"></a>III. International and Regional Instruments for Protection</b></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>International legal instruments 
  take the form of a <i>treaty</i> (also called agreement, convention, protocol) 
  which may be binding on the contracting states. When negotiations are completed, 
  the text of a treaty is established as authentic and definitive and is “signed” 
  to that effect by the representatives of states. There are various means by 
  which a state expresses its consent to be bound by a treaty. The most common 
  are ratification or accession. A new treaty is “ratified” by those states who 
  have negotiated the instrument. A state which has not participated in the negotiations 
  may, at a later stage, “accede” to the treaty. The treaty <i>enters into force</i> 
  when a pre-determined number of states have ratified or acceded to the treaty. 
  </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>When a state ratifies or accedes 
  to a treaty, that state may make <i>reservations</i> to one or more articles 
  of the treaty, unless reservations are prohibited by the treaty. Reservations 
  may normally be withdrawn at any time. In some countries, international treaties 
  take precedence over national law; in others, a specific law may be required 
  to give an international treaty, although ratified or acceded to, the force 
  of a national law. Practically all states that have ratified or acceded to an 
  international treaty must issue decrees, amend existing laws or introduce new 
  legislation in order for the treaty to be fully effective on the national territory.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>Many international treaties 
  have a mechanism to monitor the implementation of the treaty. The Refugee Convention 
  does not have such a body that monitors state obligations and commitments towards 
  asylum seekers.</span></font></p>

  be at least equivalent to freedoms enjoyed by foreign nationals living legally

  the international scope of refugee crises and necessity of international cooperation 
  -- including burden-sharing among states -- in tackling the problem. As of 1

  (1969)<b><br>
  </b>Accepted the definition of the 1951 Refugee Convention and expanded it to 
  include people who were compelled to leave their country not only as a result 
  of persecution but also owing to: external aggression, occupation, foreign domination 
  or<span> events seriously disturbing public order. </span>This definition is 
  a wider definition than the one found in the UN Refugee Convention and adapts 
  the definition to the reality of the developing world<span>. </span>The African 
  Union’s definition also recognizes non-state groups as perpetrators of persecution<span>  
  and it does not demand that a refugee shows a direct link between herself or 
  himself and the future danger. It is sufficient that the refugee considers the 
  harm sufficient to force her/him to abandon their home. </span></span></p>

  for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</a> </span></b><span>(1949) 
  (article 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16)</span></p>
<p><span>The European Convention on Human Rights does not contain any right to 
  asylum and it makes no direct reference to asylum seekers or refugees. A very 
  important case by the European Court of Human Rights (<i>Soering v. the United 
  Kingdom</i>, 1989), however, established that states were indeed responsible, 
  in certain instances, for the well being of individuals in other countries. 
  The case concerned article 3 of the European Convention that &quot;No one shall 
  be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&quot;. 
  In recent years the European Court has again stressed the unconditional nature 
  of the prohibition against ill-treatment and established the principle that 
  a state wishing to deport even an individual found guilty of a serious criminal 
  offence or constituting a threat to national security must first make an independent 
  evaluation of the circumstances the individual would face in the country of 
  return. Although article 3 is most often called upon to protect asylum seekers 
  and refugees, other articles may also be invoked to ensure that their human 
  rights are respected. In particular article 4 (prohibition of forced or compulsory 
  labour), article 5 (deprivation of liberty), article 6 (right to a fair and 
  impartial hearing &quot;within a reasonable time&quot;), article 8 (respect 
  for private and family life), article 9 (right to freedom of thought, conscience 
  and religion), article 10 (right to freedom of expression), article 13 (right 
  to the grant of an effective remedy before a national authority) and article 
  16 (no restrictions on political activity of aliens) can offer substantial protection.</span></p>

<p><b><span><a href="http://www.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cartagena1984.html">Cartagena 
  Declaration on Refugees</a></span></b><span> (1984)</span></p>
<p>The refugee definition of the Cartagena Declaration builds upon the OAU adding 
  to it the threat of generalized violence; internal aggression; and massive violation 
  of human rights. Unlike the definition in the refugee convention by the African 
  Union, however, a refugee must show a link between herself or himself and the 
  real risk of harm; all applicants must demonstrate that &quot;their lives, safety 
  or freedom have been threatened&quot;. This demand is similar to the UN Refugee 
  Convention, which requires individuals to show that they risk persecution as 
  a particular individual rather than in general. Although not formally binding, 
  the Cartagena Declaration has become the basis of refugee policy in the region 
  and has been incorporated in to the national legislation of a number of States.</p>

  Protection and Service Agencies</span></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 1951 Refugee Convention does 
  not force a state to admit a refugee, that is to grant asylum. It is clear that 
  there is a gap here between the individual’s right to seek asylum and the state’s 
  discretion in providing it. As a result of this ambiguous state of affairs, 
  government’s practice in granting asylum varies widely, both in terms of the 
  procedure they use for determining refugee status and the actual legislation 
  that is applied. States can ask the UNHCR for assistance in determining refugee 
  status.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>A majority of states that 
  have ratified the Refugee Convention have not adopted domestic legislation to 
  implement this treaty. Nonetheless, many of these countries have provided protection 
  to massive numbers of individuals fleeing persecution. Although this action 
  has saved many lives, it has rarely been accompanied by procedures for individually 
  determining refugee status. As a result, refugees in these countries are often 
  uncertain as to their status and rights, and have no guarantee that they will 
  not be arbitrarily returned. Approximately one-third of the states that have 
  ratified the Refugee Convention have enacted domestic legislation to implement 
  the treaty. Although the details of the legislation vary a great deal from state 
  to state, there are certain common elements arising out of the commitments of 
  the Refugee Convention and as a result of the procedures recommended by the 
  UNHCR.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>These states generally offer 
  asylum to individuals who conform to the article 1 A (2) definition of a refugee. 
  There is room for interpretation, however. For example:</span></font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span>What constitutes persecution? </span></font></p>

  </span></span> <span>What evidence shows that a fear is well founded? </span></font></p>
<p> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span>How are the grounds for persecution defined (race, religion,

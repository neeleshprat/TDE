This advice may lead to policies and bylaws within municipalities. The following are some examples.</p><p>In Ontario, local public health departments address smoking, scents, pesticides and vehicle idling. Special consideration may be given to people with environmental sensitivities in the event that pesticides are sprayed against mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus. Ottawa Public Health instituted a voluntary registry so that people with environmental sensitivities will receive increased notice should the city consider fogging with malathion in response to West Nile virus. Ottawa also has a safe public housing project for people with environmental sensitivities. The Region of Peel is studying fragrances from laundry facilities. </p><p>Many Canadian cities,<sup><a href="/research_program_recherche/esensitivities_hypersensibilitee/page3-eng.aspx?lang_update=1#d" title="d"><span>d</span></a></sup> including most capitals, have anti-idling bylaws or policies (e.g. for vehicle fleets), idling-free zones (e.g. around schools) or educational initiatives. These are for both energy conservation and cleaner air.</p><p>Halifax was the first major Canadian city to enact a pesticide bylaw. As well, municipal employees who became sensitive to chlorine in public swimming facilities have been accommodated with changes in place of work. </p><p>Almost 130 cities in Canada now restrict the use of pesticides on private property, in part to protect people with environmental sensitivities.<sup><a href="/research_program_recherche/esensitivities_hypersensibilitee/page14-eng.aspx" title="63"><span>63</span></a></sup> </p><p>Calgary Public Health has no-scent, latex and pesticides policies. A ban on smoking in public places is coming in 2007. Unlike most Canadian provinces, Alberta does not have provincial no-smoking legislation.</p><p><a name="314"></a>Summary</p><p>Since diagnostic criteria for chemical sensitivity have been accepted internationally and in Canada, the recognition of environmental sensitivities at all levels of government has been steadily increasing. Environmental sensitivities and some related conditions are also eligible for compensation by some Workers&#8217; Compensation Boards, although there is marked inconsistency across the country. Public policy and regulations are advancing to protect people from tobacco smoke, pesticides, fragrances, vehicle exhaust and other chemicals in public places, and to minimize risks of exposures to pesticides for people with sensitivities. </p><p><a name="32"></a>Awareness of environmental sensitivities by health care practitioners</p><p><a name="321"></a>Physicians organizations </p><p>The mandate of the <a href="http://www.amc.ca/" title="Canadian Medical Association">Canadian Medical Association</a>&nbsp;is "To serve and unite the physicians of Canada and be the national advocate, in partnership with the people of Canada, for the highest standards of health and health care". The medical associations at the national and provincial levels do not formally "recognize" diseases, although they do engage in limited advocacy such as a resolution calling for banning of "weed and feed" type products.<sup><a href="/research_program_recherche/esensitivities_hypersensibilitee/page14-eng.aspx" title="64"><span>64</span></a></sup> A 1995 letter on behalf of the Ontario Medical Association to the Ontario Ministry of Education Special Education Advisory Council urged that "multiple sensitivities syndrome" be recognized and dealt with as a disability and that environmental improvements be made to accommodate children with this special need. As well, articles have been published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal on environmental sensitivities.<sup><a href="/research_program_recherche/esensitivities_hypersensibilitee/page14-eng.aspx" title="65-68"><span>65-68 </span></a></sup></p><p>The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) is a national, private, non-profit organization th at oversees the medical education of specialists in Canada. It notes on its website, "In recognition of employees who experience allergic reactions, asthma or migraine headaches due to chemical sensitivities, the Royal College supports a scent-free environment and requests that employees refrain from using scented products such as perfumes, aftershaves, air-fresheners, etc., during working hours." </p><p>The Environmental Health Committee of the Ontario College of Family Physicians (OCFP) is taking the lead within the College of Family Physicians of Canada on environmental health, as well as in the <a href="http://www.globalfamilydoctor.com/" title="World Organization of Family Doctors">World Organization of Family Doctors</a>. Not only are environmental sensitivities recognized, they are carrying out education on diagnosis and treatment, as well as many other environmental health initiatives. </p><p>The Canadian Society of Environmental Medicine is a national organization for education, advocacy and research, and supports health care workers treating environmental sensitivities. </p><p>An important voice for environmental health in Canada is the <a href="http://www.cape.ca/" title="Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment">Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment</a>. This organization is composed mostly of physicians, who bring their health expertise to environmental issues.</p><p><a name="322"></a>Medical schools and continuing medical education</p><p>Environmental sensitivities have not historically been included explicitly in medical school curricula. Connections between environment and health are typically addressed under courses such as "Individual and Population Health," with a couple of hour-long lectures during the entire medical education. An "exposure history," a crucial step in diagnosing environmental sensitivities,<sup><a href="/research_program_recherche/esensitivities_hypersensibilitee/page14-eng.aspx" title="65,69"><span>65,69</span></a></sup> is covered only in the context of occupational health, rather than as a core concept. </p><p>Continuing Professional Development or Continuing Medical Education is required for fellows of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, as well as for members of the College of Family Physicians of Canada. Credits are earned for courses, conferences and seminars. Diverse courses are available through numerous organizations, and individuals choose which to take. The OCFP offers Continuing Medical Education regarding environmental sensitivities and taking of a comprehensive patient history. Workshops have also been part of the Annual Scientific Assembly of the OCFP for the past four years, and been included in the annual "Family Medicine Forum" sponsored by the College of Family Physicians of Canada. As well, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care and Health Canada helped fund an Environmental Health Peer Presenter program for physicians, whereby physicians from various regions were trained to give seminars on environmental health to other health care professionals close to home. </p><p>In 2006, an Environmental Health Scholar was designated by the OCFP in each medical school in Ontario, in part to incorporate environmental health into the undergraduate medical curriculum. </p><p>Environmental sciences are increasingly popular in university education, with courses offered through many departments such as geography, engineering or sciences; some of these courses link to health sciences.</p><p><a name="323"></a>Summary</p><p>Awareness and recognition of chronic health conditions evolves over time, and on several levels. Initial reporting by a few patients and physicians leads to awareness, research and formal agreement regarding diagnosis. Further research explores causes, mechanisms, diagnostic tests and treatment strategies, which are then formally put into practice. </p><p>International, national, provincial and municipal governments have recognized conditions related to environmental sensitivities. This has led to funding for clinical health care programs and facilities. Public and political awareness are particularly important for conditions such as environmental sensitivities, because recognition of environmental causes has diverse implications for many interests in society. </p><p>The medical community is increasingly acknowledging environmental sensitivities in medical education. Scent-free and least-toxic cleaning policies, and advocacy for smoking, vehicle idling and pesticides policies and laws are increasing.</p><p><a name="c">c.</a> ANSI/ASHRAE Addendum c to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2004,&nbsp; American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia.<br /><a name="d">d.</a> Including Ottawa, Toronto,&nbsp; Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Winnipeg, Mississauga, Markham, Oshawa, London, Halifax, St. John&#8217;s and all of PEI and Quebec</p><p>&nbsp;</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="center" align="center"><a href="/research_program_recherche/esensitivities_hypersensibilitee/page2-eng.aspx" title="Previous Page">Previous Page</a></td><td valign="center" align="center"><a href="/research_program_recherche/esensitivities_hypersensibilitee/toc_tdm-eng.aspx" title="Table of Contents">Table of Contents</a></td><td valign="center" align="center"><a href="/research_program_recherche/esensitivities_hypersensibilitee/page4-eng.aspx" title="Next Page">Next Page </a></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
